This weekend he will be sharing some very specific disoveries and facilitating student discovery of their own connection with this sacred literature.\n\nTogether we will explore and study some of the less known yet important Works of Bahá'u'lláh from the three major periods of His Ministry.\n\n\n![school front](/courses/school-front2.jpg#floater)\n### Where will this be held?\n\nIn the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.\n\n\n\n![the Bab's haykal](/courses/temple-wilmette.jpg#floater2)\n### Who should attend? (ages 15+)\n\nGiven the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.\n\n\n\n### What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)\n\nEvery student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.\n\n\n![participants](/db-challenge/db-banner-2019.jpg#floater)\n\n### How much? ($110)\n\nWe’re working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes three nights lodging and eight meals. As well as transportation to and from the airport, if you are arriving by plane.\n\nOur costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.\n\n<br><br><br><br>\n","data":{"id":"monjazeb-discovering-gems","title":"Discovering the Hidden Gems beneath the Ocean of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation","teachers":["Shahrokh Monjazeb"],"facebook":"","image":"/courses/shahrokh-nar.jpg","hero":{"src":"/courses/shahrokh-wide.jpg","alt":"Shahrokh Monjazeb, a man with a short black beard and energetic eyes, giving a talk"},"schema":{"type":"Course"}},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"\nShahrokh Monjazeb will explore some of the less known yet important Works of Bahá'u'lláh from the three major periods of His Ministry.\n\n","path":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/courses/monjazeb-discovering-gems.md","meta":{"image":{"src":"/courses/shahrokh-nar.jpg","alt":"Discovering the Hidden Gems beneath the Ocean of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation"},"schema":{"type":"Course"},"id":"monjazeb-discovering-gems","title":"Discovering the Hidden Gems beneath the Ocean of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation","teachers":["Shahrokh Monjazeb"],"facebook":"","hero":{"src":"/courses/shahrokh-wide.jpg","alt":"Shahrokh Monjazeb, a man with a short black beard and energetic eyes, giving a talk"},"file":{"path":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/courses/monjazeb-discovering-gems.md","date":"2021-01-05T15:23:02.362Z","size":3202},"pubdate":"2021-01-05","description":"Shahrokh Monjazeb will explore some of the less known yet important Works of Bahá'u'lláh from the three major periods of His Ministry.","slug":"monjazeb-discovering-gems","href":"/courses/monjazeb-discovering-gems"},"html":"<h2>A Weekend Study Retreat with Shahrokh Monjazeb</h2>\n<pre><code>Retreat Address: 1999 Ridge Rd, North San Juan, CA 95960\n Contact Kaathlyn Connor at (530) 777 8275, operations@firm-foundation.org\n Arrive: Friday evening, the 29th of May for dinner and orientation\n Depart: Monday morning, the 1st of June after dawn-prayers and breakfast\n</code></pre>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"/courses/shahrokh-cover-bahaullah.jpg#floater2\" alt=\"book: baha'u'llah\" /></p>\n<p>Shahrokh is a frequent presenter on taking a deeper dive into the revealed Bahá'í literature.
