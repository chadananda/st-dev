Now that we have all enjoyed celebrating the Bicentennial of the birth of the Báb, it’s probably about time we get serious about doing that.</p> <p>Together, we will read and discuss every page of the Dawn-Breakers, track every character, map every city and essentially rise to the Guardian’s challenge that we <em>“...master and digest the facts recorded therein...”</em> It’s going to be a lot of work and a lot of fun.</p> <p>Our outcome goals are clear: participants should know the stories and be able to identify the twenty-six key characters — as well as be able to accompany others in reading these important books once they return home. As the Guardian promised us, <em>“No one can read The Dawn-Breakers and remain cold and unreceptive.”</em> Studying that book is a powerful spiritual journey — a quickening of the soul.</p> <p><img alt="group photo of dawn-breakers challenge 2019 participants" src=/db-challenge/db-chall-jul-2019.jpg#floater></p> <h3>Where will this be held?</h3> <p>In the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.</p> <h3>When?</h3> <p>Early every month in 2020 -- beginning with April. We know everyone has different schedules and commitments, so we thought, “Let’s just keep repeating every month, all year! Surely anyone who really wants to attend can find some month that works.”</p> <p><img alt="participants dawn-breakers challenge 2019" src=/db-challenge/participants.jpg#floater></p> <h3>Who should attend? (ages 15-112)</h3> <p>Given the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.</p> <h3>Why should I do this now? (if not now, then when?)</h3> <p>The Guardian assures us that studying the Dawn-Breakers has a profound mystical effect on our dormant spiritual powers. It should not be a surprise therefore that Shoghi Effendi called on all the Baha’is (especially the youth) to master this book as a basis for teaching. He explained that it is not just a book of history, but a book of meditation. And he assured us that studying that book would quicken our dormant energies in a completely new way.</p> <p>But let’s be honest. It’s a very difficult book, Northern California is far away, 10 days is a lot of time and the demands of our material life fill up our calendars, sometimes years in advance. Nevertheless, the bicentennial of the birth of the Báb is now upon us! So, if not now, then when?</p> <p>Whatever your current plans are this summer, we hope you will change them and join our little mountain retreat for a few days of spiritual adventure.</p> <p><img alt="bring Ocean 2.0" src=/db-challenge/bayan-db-challenge.jpg#floater></p> <h3>What to Bring? (computer, books, light clothes, shampoo)</h3> <p>Every student should bring their own copy of the Dawn-Breakers or a tablet or laptop computer with <a href=/ocean>Ocean 2.0 Reader installed →</a>. Pens, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. The mountain air can be a bit cooler than one might expect for California, so prehaps bring some layered clothes. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.</p> <h3>How much? ($320)</h3> <p>We're working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes eleven nights and 32 meals plus lots and lots of coffee.</p> <p>Our costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.</p> <p><br><br><br><br></p> </div> </div></main></div> <div class="absolute mr-0 pr-1 right-0 text-gray-400 text-xs top-0"><span class=sm:hidden>xs</span> <span class="hidden sm:inline md:hidden">sm</span><span class="hidden md:inline lg:hidden">md</span> <span class="hidden lg:inline xl:hidden">lg</span><span class="hidden xl:inline">xl</span> </div> <footer class="p-2 bg-gray-100 border bottom-0 flex font-bold justify-between rounded-t-lg sticky text-gray-500 text-xs w-full"><div><a href=/about class=svelte-eqzwux>About</a> <a href=/contact class=svelte-eqzwux>Contact</a> <a href=/privacy class=svelte-eqzwux>Privacy</a></div> <div class=copyright><a href=/ class=svelte-eqzwux>©2021 <span class="hidden sm:inline">sacred-traditions.org</span></a> | <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ynPUPOCg49HbfF_szXOyhayiaU0ZdhWnioXWgDojJns/edit class=svelte-eqzwux>admin</a></div> </footer></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,{},]};if('serviceWorker' in navigator)navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');var s=document.createElement("script");try{new Function("if(0)import('')")();s.src="/client/client.6ee85d9d.js";s.type="module";s.crossOrigin="use-credentials";}catch(e){s.src="/client/shimport@1.0.1.js";s.setAttribute("data-main","/client/client.6ee85d9d.js")}document.head.appendChild(s)</script> <script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.6.26/webfont.js></script> <script> WebFont.load({
