He said: "O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of "Ya Bahá’u’l-Abhá" in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it."</p> <p>It seems completely fitting, then, in the centennial year of the Master’s passing, that Bahá’ís everywhere might re-focus their energies and efforts on promoting the divine teachings. Nothing, we suspect, would make Abdu’l-Bahá happier.</p> <p>The class will be presented by David and Teresa Langness. David will focus on teaching the Faith by learning how to speak and write with "an eloquent tongue and a ready pen;" and Teresa will focus on teaching the Faith "with a goodly character and righteous ways and deeds," especially as they pertain to starting and running Bahá’í-inspired social and economic development projects.</p> <p>In his work for the past eight years with the world’s largest Bahá’í website – www.BahaiTeachings.org – David has written and edited more than five thousand essays that have introduced millions of seekers to the Faith. In her work over the past 25 years with Full-Circle Learning – www.fullcirclelearning.org – Teresa Langness has taught the unifying principles of the Faith to millions around the world with her Bahá’í-inspired educational curriculum, now being taught in thousands of schools in 34 nations.</p> <p><img alt="software with tablet of ahmad" src=/courses/david-langness.jpg#floater2></p> <h3>This Unique Weekend Exploration will Include</h3> <ul> <li> <p>A deep study of the essential "first obligation" of every Bahá’í to teach the Faith, and of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and Abdu’l-Bahá on teaching.</p> </li> <li> <p>Concurrently, a historical and anecdotal look at the daily life of the Master, and the lessons he taught through his actions about the spiritual requirement to serve humanity by carrying forth an ever-advancing civilization.</p> </li> <li> <p>A review of a newly-compiled digest of the Writings on teaching the Faith through speaking, writing and service.</p> </li> <li> <p>How to effectively reach and teach agnostics and atheists.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creating and sustaining devotionals and firesides based solely on the Writings themselves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Surprising statistical analyses of what most intrigues and inspires the online seeker, with data-driven evidence drawn from BahaiTeachings.org’s reach, effectiveness and most popular topics.</p> </li> <li> <p>Audience participation and brainstorming on potential new teaching and service activities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inspiring and sometimes hilarious teaching and service stories!</p> </li> </ul> <p>You’ll come away from this program with new ideas, new information and new inspiration for teaching and service!</p> <p><img alt="school front" src=/courses/school-front2.jpg#floater></p> <h3>Where will this be held?</h3> <p>In the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.</p> <h3>Who should attend? (ages 15+)</h3> <p>Given the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.</p> <h3>What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)</h3> <p>Every student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.</p> <p><img alt="library of arabic books" src=/db-challenge/db-banner-2019.jpg#floater></p> <h3>How much? ($110)</h3> <p>We’re working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes three nights lodging and eight meals. As well as transportation to and from the airport, if you are arriving by plane.</p> <p>Our costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.</p> <p><br><br><br><br></p> </div> </div></main></div> <div class="absolute mr-0 pr-1 right-0 text-gray-400 text-xs top-0"><span class=sm:hidden>xs</span> <span class="hidden sm:inline md:hidden">sm</span><span class="hidden md:inline lg:hidden">md</span> <span class="hidden lg:inline xl:hidden">lg</span><span class="hidden xl:inline">xl</span> </div> <footer class="p-2 bg-gray-100 border bottom-0 flex font-bold justify-between rounded-t-lg sticky text-gray-500 text-xs w-full"><div><a class=svelte-eqzwux href=/about>About</a> <a class=svelte-eqzwux href=/contact>Contact</a> <a class=svelte-eqzwux href=/privacy>Privacy</a></div> <div class=copyright><a class=svelte-eqzwux href=/ >©2021 <span class="hidden sm:inline">sacred-traditions.org</span></a> | <a class=svelte-eqzwux href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ynPUPOCg49HbfF_szXOyhayiaU0ZdhWnioXWgDojJns/edit>admin</a></div> </footer></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,{},]};if('serviceWorker' in navigator)navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');var s=document.createElement("script");try{new Function("if(0)import('')")();s.src="/client/client.6ee85d9d.js";s.type="module";s.crossOrigin="use-credentials";}catch(e){s.src="/client/shimport@1.0.1.js";s.setAttribute("data-main","/client/client.6ee85d9d.js")}document.head.appendChild(s)</script> <script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.6.26/webfont.js></script> <script> WebFont.load({
