His exhausting yet exhilarating 239-day trek from coast to coast took him to fifty cities and towns, where he delivered up to four talks a day -- about four hundred total -- to approximately 93,000 people on Bahá’u’lláh’s message of the oneness of humanity and the principles of universal peace. This historic visit to the United States planted the seeds that would take root and germinate into the present-day American Bahá’í community.</p> <p>Robert H. Stockman has been an instructor of religious studies at DePaul University in Chicago since 1990, where he teaches world religions, religion in the United States, and Islam. He has been Director of the Wilmette Institute since 2000. He has served on the editorial boards of the Bahá’í Encyclopedia Project, Journal of Bahá’í Studies, and World Order magazine.</p> <p><br><br><hr class=small><br><br><p></p> <p><img alt="school front" src=/courses/school-front2.jpg#floater></p> <h3>Where will this be held?</h3> <p>In the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.</p> <p><img alt="the Bab's haykal" src=/courses/temple-wilmette.jpg#floater2></p> <h3>Who should attend? (ages 15+)</h3> <p>Given the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.</p> <h3>What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)</h3> <p>Every student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.</p> <p><img alt=participants src=/db-challenge/db-banner-2019.jpg#floater></p> <h3>How much? ($110)</h3> <p>We’re working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes three nights lodging and eight meals. As well as transportation to and from the airport, if you are arriving by plane.</p> <p>Our costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.</p> <p><br><br><br><br></p> </div> </div></main></div> <div class="absolute mr-0 pr-1 right-0 text-gray-400 text-xs top-0"><span class=sm:hidden>xs</span> <span class="hidden sm:inline md:hidden">sm</span><span class="hidden md:inline lg:hidden">md</span> <span class="hidden lg:inline xl:hidden">lg</span><span class="hidden xl:inline">xl</span> </div> <footer class="p-2 bg-gray-100 border bottom-0 flex font-bold justify-between rounded-t-lg sticky text-gray-500 text-xs w-full"><div><a class=svelte-eqzwux href=/about>About</a> <a class=svelte-eqzwux href=/contact>Contact</a> <a class=svelte-eqzwux href=/privacy>Privacy</a></div> <div class=copyright><a class=svelte-eqzwux href=/ >©2021 <span class="hidden sm:inline">sacred-traditions.org</span></a> | <a class=svelte-eqzwux href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ynPUPOCg49HbfF_szXOyhayiaU0ZdhWnioXWgDojJns/edit>admin</a></div> </footer></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,{},]};if('serviceWorker' in navigator)navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');var s=document.createElement("script");try{new Function("if(0)import('')")();s.src="/client/client.6ee85d9d.js";s.type="module";s.crossOrigin="use-credentials";}catch(e){s.src="/client/shimport@1.0.1.js";s.setAttribute("data-main","/client/client.6ee85d9d.js")}document.head.appendChild(s)</script> <script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.6.26/webfont.js></script> <script> WebFont.load({
