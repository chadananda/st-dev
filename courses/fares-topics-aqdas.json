It “stands out, by virtue of the principles it inculcates, the administrative institutions it ordains and the function with which it invests the appointed Successor of its Author, unique and incomparable among the world’s sacred Scriptures.”\n\nNabil is a native speaker in Arabic, and Azadeh is a native speaker in Persian. They have been working together in English for decades in sharing the wonders of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas.\n\n\n\n![school front](/courses/school-front2.jpg#floater)\n### Where will this be held?\n\nIn the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.\n\n\n\n![software with tablet of ahmad](/courses/aqdas.jpg#floater2)\n### Who should attend? (ages 15+)\n\nGiven the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.\n\n\n\n### What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)\n\nEvery student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.\n\n\n![participants](/db-challenge/db-banner-2019.jpg#floater)\n\n### How much? ($110)\n\nWe’re working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes three nights lodging and eight meals. As well as transportation to and from the airport, if you are arriving by plane.\n\nOur costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.\n\n<br><br><br><br>\n","data":{"id":"fares-topics-aqdas","title":"Topical Overview of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas","teachers":["Nabil Fares","Azadeh Mohandessi-Fares"],"facebook":"","image":"/courses/azadeh-fares.jpg","hero":{"src":"/courses/azadeh-fares-wide.jpg","alt":"Azadeh Fares smiles warmly in a cafe"},"schema":{"type":"Course"}},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"\nThe Kitáb-i-Aqdas ranks among the formost treasures of Bahá’u’lláh's vast revelation.
