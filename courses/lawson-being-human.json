It explains the deep connection between the Baha’i Faith and Islam, and how this relationship is one among many in what must remain the continuing, and perhaps endless, attempts to mine the Baha’i scriptures for all their inexhaustible implications.\n\nTodd Lawson is Emeritus Professor of Islamic Thought at the University of Toronto. You can find a copy of his book here: [Being Human, by Todd Lawson ⤳](https://www.kalimatpress.com/product/being-human/)\n\n\n\n![school front](/courses/school-front2.jpg#floater)\n### Where will this be held?\n\nIn the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.\n\n\n\n![software with tablet of ahmad](/db-challenge/participants.jpg#floater2)\n### Who should attend? (ages 15+)\n\nGiven the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.\n\n\n\n### What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)\n\nEvery student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.\n\n\n![library of arabic books](/courses/school-field.jpg#floater)\n\n### How much? ($110)\n\nWe’re working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes three nights lodging and eight meals. As well as transportation to and from the airport, if you are arriving by plane.\n\nOur costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.\n\n<br><br><br><br>\n","data":{"id":"lawson-being-human","title":"Being Human: Bahá’í Perspective on Islam, Modernity, and Peace","teachers":["Todd Lawson"],"facebook":"","image":"/courses/todd-lawson_sm.jpg","hero":{"src":"/courses/todd-lawson-wide.jpg","alt":"Todd Lawson speaking at a podium"},"schema":{"type":"Course"}},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"\nJoin us for a wonderful 3-day retreat with reknowned professor Todd Lawson who will be speaking about his recent book \"Being Human\".\n\n\"Being Human\" seeks to harmonize many contradictions and demonstrate how Baha'i teachings point the way toward peace and the reconciliation of all world religions.\n\n","path":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/courses/lawson-being-human.md","meta":{"image":{"src":"/courses/todd-lawson_sm.jpg","alt":"Being Human: Bahá’í Perspective on Islam, Modernity, and Peace"},"schema":{"type":"Course"},"id":"lawson-being-human","title":"Being Human: Bahá’í Perspective on Islam, Modernity, and Peace","teachers":["Todd Lawson"],"facebook":"","hero":{"src":"/courses/todd-lawson-wide.jpg","alt":"Todd Lawson speaking at a podium"},"file":{"path":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/courses/lawson-being-human.md","date":"2021-01-05T15:23:02.498Z","size":3669},"pubdate":"2021-01-05","description":"Join us for a wonderful 3-day retreat with reknowned professor Todd Lawson who will be speaking about his recent book \"Being Human\".  \"Being Human\" seeks to harmonize many contradictions and demonstrate how Baha'i teachings point the way toward peace and the reconciliation of all world religions.","slug":"lawson-being-human","href":"/courses/lawson-being-human"},"html":"<h2>Mid-week Study Retreat with Todd Lawson</h2>\n<pre><code>Retreat Address: 1999 Ridge Rd, North San Juan, CA 95960\n Contact Kaathlyn Connor at (530) 777 8275, operations@firm-foundation.org\n Arrive: Sunday evening, the 19th of April for dinner and orientation\n Depart: Wed. morning, the 22nd of April after dawn-prayers and breakfast\n</code></pre>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"/courses/Being-Human-Front-Cover.jpg#floater2\" alt=\"temple front\" /></p>\n<p>Join us for a wonderful 3-day retreat with reknowned professor Todd Lawson who will be speaking about his recent book &quot;Being Human&quot;.</p>\n<p>Being Human seeks to reconcile many contradictions and demonstrate how Baha’i teachings point the way toward peace and the reconciliation of all world religions.
