</code></pre> <br> <p><img alt="temple front" src=/courses/Being-Human-Front-Cover.jpg#floater2></p> <p>Join us for a wonderful 3-day retreat with reknowned professor Todd Lawson who will be speaking about his recent book "Being Human".</p> <p>Being Human seeks to reconcile many contradictions and demonstrate how Baha’i teachings point the way toward peace and the reconciliation of all world religions. It explains the deep connection between the Baha’i Faith and Islam, and how this relationship is one among many in what must remain the continuing, and perhaps endless, attempts to mine the Baha’i scriptures for all their inexhaustible implications.</p> <p>Todd Lawson is Emeritus Professor of Islamic Thought at the University of Toronto. You can find a copy of his book here: <a href=https://www.kalimatpress.com/product/being-human/ >Being Human, by Todd Lawson ⤳</a></p> <p><img alt="school front" src=/courses/school-front2.jpg#floater></p> <h3>Where will this be held?</h3> <p>In the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.</p> <p><img alt="software with tablet of ahmad" src=/db-challenge/participants.jpg#floater2></p> <h3>Who should attend? (ages 15+)</h3> <p>Given the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.</p> <h3>What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)</h3> <p>Every student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.</p> <p><img alt="library of arabic books" src=/courses/school-field.jpg#floater></p> <h3>How much? ($110)</h3> <p>We’re working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes three nights lodging and eight meals. As well as transportation to and from the airport, if you are arriving by plane.</p> <p>Our costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.</p> <p><br><br><br><br></p> </div> </div></main></div> <div class="absolute mr-0 pr-1 right-0 text-gray-400 text-xs top-0"><span class=sm:hidden>xs</span> <span class="hidden sm:inline md:hidden">sm</span><span class="hidden md:inline lg:hidden">md</span> <span class="hidden lg:inline xl:hidden">lg</span><span class="hidden xl:inline">xl</span> </div> <footer class="p-2 bg-gray-100 border bottom-0 flex font-bold justify-between rounded-t-lg sticky text-gray-500 text-xs w-full"><div><a href=/about class=svelte-eqzwux>About</a> <a href=/contact class=svelte-eqzwux>Contact</a> <a href=/privacy class=svelte-eqzwux>Privacy</a></div> <div class=copyright><a href=/ class=svelte-eqzwux>©2021 <span class="hidden sm:inline">sacred-traditions.org</span></a> | <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ynPUPOCg49HbfF_szXOyhayiaU0ZdhWnioXWgDojJns/edit class=svelte-eqzwux>admin</a></div> </footer></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,{},]};if('serviceWorker' in navigator)navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');var s=document.createElement("script");try{new Function("if(0)import('')")();s.src="/client/client.6ee85d9d.js";s.type="module";s.crossOrigin="use-credentials";}catch(e){s.src="/client/shimport@1.0.1.js";s.setAttribute("data-main","/client/client.6ee85d9d.js")}document.head.appendChild(s)</script> <script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.6.26/webfont.js></script> <script> WebFont.load({
