These two letters of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá were written in response to letters addressed to Him by the Executive Committee of the Central Organization for a Durable Peace.</p> <p>These important tablets include a summation of the Bahá’í social teachings and a rebuttal of materalistic theories of progress, for example by asserting that man must unite spritually before political peace is achievable, and that man must solve the economic problem voluntarily, rather than through the force of coercive law.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/tablets-hague-abdul-baha/2#381373700>First Tablet to The Hague - 17 December 1919 ⤳</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that although material civilization is one of the means for the progress of the world of mankind, yet until it becomes combined with Divine civilization, the desired result, which is the felicity of mankind, will not be attained.</em></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is voluntary sharing of one’s property with others among mankind. This voluntary sharing is greater than equality, and consists in this, that man should not prefer himself to others, but rather should sacrifice his life and property for others. But this should not be introduced by coercion so that it becomes a law and man is compelled to follow it. Nay, rather, man should voluntarily and of his own choice sacrifice his property and life for others, and spend willingly for the poor, just as is done in Persia among the Bahá’ís.</em></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/tablets-hague-abdul-baha/3#738038819>Second Tablet to The Hague - 1 July 1920 ⤳</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>This last terrible war hath clearly proven that humanity cannot withstand the effects of modern instruments of warfare. The future can in no wise be compared to the past, for earlier weapons and armaments had but a feeble effect, whilst modern ones can, in a brief span of time, strike at the very roots of the world of humanity and surpass the limits of its endurance.</em></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <hr> <p><br><br></p> <p><img alt="school front" src=/courses/school-front2.jpg#floater></p> <h3>Where will this be held?</h3> <p>In the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.</p> <p><img alt="the hauge" src=/courses/the-hauge.jpg#floater2></p> <h3>Who should attend? (ages 15+)</h3> <p>Given the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.</p> <h3>What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)</h3> <p>Every student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.</p> <p><img alt=participants src=/db-challenge/db-banner-2019.jpg#floater></p> <h3>How much? ($110)</h3> <p>We’re working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes three nights lodging and eight meals. As well as transportation to and from the airport, if you are arriving by plane.</p> <p>Our costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.</p> <p><br><br><br><br></p> </div> </div></main></div> <div class="absolute mr-0 pr-1 right-0 text-gray-400 text-xs top-0"><span class=sm:hidden>xs</span> <span class="hidden sm:inline md:hidden">sm</span><span class="hidden md:inline lg:hidden">md</span> <span class="hidden lg:inline xl:hidden">lg</span><span class="hidden xl:inline">xl</span> </div> <footer class="p-2 bg-gray-100 border bottom-0 flex font-bold justify-between rounded-t-lg sticky text-gray-500 text-xs w-full"><div><a href=/about class=svelte-eqzwux>About</a> <a href=/contact class=svelte-eqzwux>Contact</a> <a href=/privacy class=svelte-eqzwux>Privacy</a></div> <div class=copyright><a href=/ class=svelte-eqzwux>©2021 <span class="hidden sm:inline">sacred-traditions.org</span></a> | <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ynPUPOCg49HbfF_szXOyhayiaU0ZdhWnioXWgDojJns/edit class=svelte-eqzwux>admin</a></div> </footer></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,{},]};if('serviceWorker' in navigator)navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');var s=document.createElement("script");try{new Function("if(0)import('')")();s.src="/client/client.6ee85d9d.js";s.type="module";s.crossOrigin="use-credentials";}catch(e){s.src="/client/shimport@1.0.1.js";s.setAttribute("data-main","/client/client.6ee85d9d.js")}document.head.appendChild(s)</script> <script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.6.26/webfont.js></script> <script> WebFont.load({
