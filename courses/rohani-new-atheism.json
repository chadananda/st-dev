If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.\n\n\n\n![book cover](/courses/sours-prophecies-jesus.jpg#floater2)\n### Who should attend? (ages 15+)\n\nGiven the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.\n\n\n\n### What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)\n\nEvery student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.\n\n\n![participants](/db-challenge/db-banner-2019.jpg#floater)\n\n### How much? ($110)\n\nWe’re working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes three nights lodging and eight meals. As well as transportation to and from the airport, if you are arriving by plane.\n\nOur costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.\n\n<br><br><br><br>\n","data":{"id":"rohani-new-atheism","title":"New Atheism and Seeing with the Eye of God","teachers":["Michael Sours Rohani"],"facebook":"","image":"/courses/sours-tall.jpg","hero":{"src":"/courses/sours-wide.jpg","alt":"The cover of a book by Michael Sours, with a line-drawn picture of an ancient city on a hill"},"schema":{"type":"Course"}},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"\nMichael (Sours) Rohani will be presenting on the strange assumptions which rise from a distinctly Christian \"New Atheism\" and the implications of Baha'u'llah's assertion of two distinct types of knowledge from the Kitáb-i-Íqán.\n\n","path":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/courses/rohani-new-atheism.md","meta":{"image":{"src":"/courses/sours-tall.jpg","alt":"New Atheism and Seeing with the Eye of God"},"schema":{"type":"Course"},"id":"rohani-new-atheism","title":"New Atheism and Seeing with the Eye of God","teachers":["Michael Sours Rohani"],"facebook":"","hero":{"src":"/courses/sours-wide.jpg","alt":"The cover of a book by Michael Sours, with a line-drawn picture of an ancient city on a hill"},"file":{"path":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/courses/rohani-new-atheism.md","date":"2021-01-05T15:23:03.216Z","size":4375},"pubdate":"2021-01-05","description":"Michael (Sours) Rohani will be presenting on the strange assumptions which rise from a distinctly Christian \"New Atheism\" and the implications of Baha'u'llah's assertion of two distinct types of knowledge from the Kitáb-i-Íqán.","slug":"rohani-new-atheism","href":"/courses/rohani-new-atheism"},"html":"<h2>A Weekend Study Retreat with Michael (Sours) Rohani</h2>\n<pre><code>Retreat Address: 1999 Ridge Rd, North San Juan, CA 95960\n Contact Kaathlyn Connor at (530) 777 8275, operations@firm-foundation.org\n Arrive: Friday evening, the 31st of July for dinner and orientation\n Depart: Monday morning, the 3rd of August after dawn-prayers and breakfast\n</code></pre>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"/courses/sours-without-syllable.jpg#floater2\" alt=\"book cover\" /></p>\n<p>Michael will be presenting on the strange assumptions which rise from a distinctly Christian &quot;New Atheism&quot; and the implications of Baha'u'llah's assertion of two distinct types of knowledge from the Kitáb-i-Íqán.</p>\n<h3>Dr. Sours is the author of numerous books exploring Interfaith topics and Bilical teachings</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Biblical-Evidence-Preparing-Christian/dp/1851680187/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=michael+sours&amp;qid=1582476572&amp;sr=8-1\">Understanding Biblical Evidence</a></strong> Preparing for a Bahá'í and Christian Dialog, the first volume of a three-volume study programme designed to help Bahá'ís familiarize themselves with the Bible and Christian beliefs.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Prophecies-Jesus-Michael-Sours/dp/185168025X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=michael+sours&amp;qid=1582476821&amp;sr=8-2\">The Prophecies of Jesus</a></strong> In the 19th century, many Christians throughout the western world expected the fulfilment of Jesus's promise to return.
