{"content":"\n\n## A Weekend Study Retreat with Nader Saiedi\n\n```\nRetreat Address: 1999 Ridge Rd, North San Juan, CA 95960\n Contact Kaathlyn Connor at (530) 777 8275, operations@firm-foundation.org\n Arrive: Friday evening, the 18th of September for dinner and orientation\n Depart: Monday morning, the 21st of September after dawn-prayers and breakfast\n```\n\n<br>\n\n![book: gate of the heart](/courses/gate-heart.jpg#floater2)\n\nTaking an interdisciplinary approach, Nader Saiedi examines the Báb’s major works in multifaceted context, explaining the unique theological system, mystical world view, and interpretive principles they embody as well as the rhetorical and symbolic uses of language through which the Báb radically transforms traditional concepts. Arguing that the Bábí movement went far beyond an attempt at an Islamic Reformation, the author explores controversial issues and offers conclusions that will compel a re-evaluation of some prevalent assumptions about the Báb’s station, claims, and laws.\n\nNader Saiedi’s meticulous and insightful analysis identifies the key themes, terms, and concepts that characterize each stage of the Báb’s writings, unlocking the code of the Báb’s mystical lexicon. Gate of the Heart is a subtle and profound textual study and an essential resource for anyone wishing to understand the theological foundations of the Bahá’í religion and the Báb’s significance in religious history.\n\n\n\n![school front](/courses/school-front2.jpg#floater)\n### Where will this be held?\n\nIn the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.\n\n\n\n![the Bab's haykal](/courses/haykal-Bab-wide.gif#floater2)\n### Who should attend? (ages 15+)\n\nGiven the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.\n\n\n\n### What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)\n\nEvery student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.\n\n\n![participants](/db-challenge/db-banner-2019.jpg#floater)\n\n### How much? ($110)\n\nWe’re working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes three nights lodging and eight meals. As well as transportation to and from the airport, if you are arriving by plane.\n\nOur costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.\n\n<br><br><br><br>\n","data":{"id":"saiedi-writings-bab","title":"The Writings and the Worldview of the Báb","teachers":["Nader Saiedi"],"facebook":"","image":"/courses/nader-saiedi-nar.jpg","hero":{"src":"/courses/nader-saiedi-wide.jpg","alt":"Nader Saiedi talks at a lectern where boquets of flowers are arranged"},"schema":{"type":"Course"}},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"\nTaking an interdisciplinary approach, Nader Saiedi examines the Báb’s major works in multifaceted context, explaining the unique theological system, mystical world view, and interpretive principles they embody as well as the rhetorical and symbolic uses of language through which the Báb radically transforms traditional concepts.\n\n","path":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/courses/saiedi-writings-bab.md","meta":{"image":{"src":"/courses/nader-saiedi-nar.jpg","alt":"The Writings and the Worldview of the Báb"},"schema":{"type":"Course"},"id":"saiedi-writings-bab","title":"The Writings and the Worldview of the Báb","teachers":["Nader Saiedi"],"facebook":"","hero":{"src":"/courses/nader-saiedi-wide.jpg","alt":"Nader Saiedi talks at a lectern where boquets of flowers are arranged"},"file":{"path":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/courses/saiedi-writings-bab.md","date":"2021-01-05T15:23:02.682Z","size":3982},"pubdate":"2021-01-05","description":"Taking an interdisciplinary approach, Nader Saiedi examines the Báb’s major works in multifaceted context, explaining the unique theological system, mystical world view, and interpretive principles they embody as well as the rhetorical and symbolic uses of language through which the Báb radically transforms traditional concepts.","slug":"saiedi-writings-bab","href":"/courses/saiedi-writings-bab"},"html":"<h2>A Weekend Study Retreat with Nader Saiedi</h2>\n<pre><code>Retreat Address: 1999 Ridge Rd, North San Juan, CA 95960\n Contact Kaathlyn Connor at (530) 777 8275, operations@firm-foundation.org\n Arrive: Friday evening, the 18th of September for dinner and orientation\n Depart: Monday morning, the 21st of September after dawn-prayers and breakfast\n</code></pre>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"/courses/gate-heart.jpg#floater2\" alt=\"book: gate of the heart\" /></p>\n<p>Taking an interdisciplinary approach, Nader Saiedi examines the Báb’s major works in multifaceted context, explaining the unique theological system, mystical world view, and interpretive principles they embody as well as the rhetorical and symbolic uses of language through which the Báb radically transforms traditional concepts.
