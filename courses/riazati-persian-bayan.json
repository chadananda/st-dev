In it He laid down the laws and precepts of His Dispensation, plainly and emphatically announced the advent of a subsequent Revelation, and persistently urged His followers to seek and find “Him whom God would make manifest,” warning them lest they allow the mysteries and allusions in the Bayán to interfere with their recognition of His Cause.\n\n#### On Kitáb-i-Panj Sha'n, from “Gate of the Heart”\n\n> **Kitáb-i-Panj Sha'n** (Book of the Five Modes of Revelation). One of the last major works of the Báb, this book was written within the first days of the spring of 1850, the final year of the Báb's life, three or four months before His martyrdom. Panj Sha'n consists of nineteen chapters, each dealing with one of the names of God, corresponding to the first nineteen days of the year, that is, the days of the month of Bahá (Glory). These names also correspond to the nineteen figures of the Bábí Primal Unity. Panj Sha'n explains many fundamental spiritual concepts such as nearness to God, light, beauty, and unity. Each chapter was written in honour of one of the Bábís, and the chapters can all be considered as independent tablets as well. The Tablet of Hurufat, or Tablet of Nineteen Temples, is one of these chapters.\n\n\n####  On the Kitáb-i-Íqán, from “God Passes By”\n\n> Foremost among the priceless treasures cast forth from the billowing ocean of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation ranks the **Kitáb-i-Íqán** (Book of Certitude), revealed within the space of two days and two nights, in the closing years of that period (1278 A. H.–1862 A.D.). It was written in fulfillment of the prophecy of the Báb, Who had specifically stated that the Promised One would complete the text of the unfinished Persian Bayán\n\n\n---\n<br><br>\n\n\n![school front](/courses/school-front2.jpg#floater)\n### Where will this be held?\n\nIn the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.\n\n\n\n![closeup of haykal](/courses/haykal-close.png#floater2)\n### Who should attend? (ages 15+)\n\nGiven the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.\n\n\n\n### What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)\n\nEvery student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.\n\n\n![participants](/db-challenge/db-banner-2019.jpg#floater)\n\n### How much? ($110)\n\nWe’re working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes three nights lodging and eight meals. As well as transportation to and from the airport, if you are arriving by plane.\n\nOur costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.\n\n<br><br><br><br>\n","data":{"id":"riazati-persian-bayan","title":"Persian Bayán, Panj-Sha’n and Kitáb-i-Íqán","teachers":["Habib Riazati"],"facebook":"","image":"/courses/habib-tall.png","hero":{"src":"/courses/habib-wide.png","alt":"Habib Riazati speaking at a lectern and gestering animatedly with both hands"},"schema":{"type":"Course"}},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"\nAs He lay confined within the walls of the castle, He devoted His time to the composition of the **Persian Bayán**, the most weighty, the most illuminating and comprehensive of all His works.
