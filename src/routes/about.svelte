<h1>About Sacred Traditions</h1>

<p>As the world contracts due to technology, difference between ideas and culture become more and more apparent. A wonderful result has been the many movements towards Interfaith tolerance. But "tolerance" is a bit boring. Or little organization is not so interested in tolerance but ratner "appreciation". "Appreciation" is what you see when you consider the wide popularity of the Muslim / Iranian mystical poet Rumi throughout the West. The truth is that ideas are owned by no-one and everyone. And the reality of every religion is a collection of big ideas. "Tolerance" is to accept that we have different ideas. "Appreciation" is to recognize that there is much universal value in the ideas of others.

<p>In this modern era, the world's religious traditions are no longer isolated by language, culture and geography. Rather, the world's great religious literature represents a common heritage of the entire human race. The challenge for us is to find a wider appreciation of this great and ancient conversation between the human race and its creator. In this conversation are the threads of eternal truth which bind us all together into a wider story.

<h2> Projects </h2>

<p> In 2019 we hosted a half-dozen seminar retreats at a facility in the Sierra Mountains of Northern California. In 2020 we will do the same and try to expand the program with as many interesting interfaith speakers as possible.</p>

<p>Also in 2019 we launched the free cross-platform app "<a href="https://oceanlibrary.com">Ocean 2.0 Interfaith Reader</a>" -- an ebook reader loaded with the world's religious literature with many books audio aligned word-for-word for a delightful read-along experience. The program runs on most platforms including Mac, Windows, Android and iOS (as well as some Linux support)</p>
