<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>We are a group of friends of various religious backgrounds interested in sharing experiences
related to the most important part of our religion â€” our sacred literature. Religion has many varied aspects but
the part that we share is the fact that our sacred experience is about the idea of the Word of God -- in all its implications.
</p>

<p>The Word of God is, in every tradition, a sacred gift. These are words which motivate and change us -- inviting and empowering us to become
 something more, something better. It is a big idea that God speaks to mankind from age to age and that mankind is enobled
through the contemplation of God's word.
</p>

<p>In this modern era, the world's religious traditions are no longer isolated by language, culture and geography. Rather, the world's great religious literature represents a common heritage of the entire
human race. The challenge for us is to find a wider appreciation of this great and ancient conversation between the human race and its creator. In this conversation are the threads of eternal truth which bind us all together into a wider story.

<h2> Projects </h2>

<p> In 2019 we hosted a half-dozen seminar retreats at a facility in the Sierra Mountains of Northern California. In 2020 we will do the same and try to expand the program with as many interesting interfaith speakers as possible.</p>

<p>Also in 2019 we launched the free cross-platform app "<a href="/ocean">Ocean 2.0 Interfaith Reader</a>" -- an ebook reader loaded with the world's religious literature with many books audio aligned word-for-word for a delightful read-along experience. The program runs on most platforms including Mac, Windows, Android and iOS (as well as some Linux support)</p>
