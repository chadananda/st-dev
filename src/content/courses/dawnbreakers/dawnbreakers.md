## Study Retreat, 10 Days: The Dawn-Breakers Challenge 2020

Please join us in Northern California this summer for a fun and intensive 10-day study of “The Dawn-Breakers” together with the primary doctrinal work of the Bahá'í Faith, “The Kitáb-i-Íqán.” As you know, the Guardian challenged us to “master” these books as a rock-foundation for effective teaching. Now that the Bicentennial of the bith of the Báb is upon us, it’s probably about time to get serious about doing just that.

Together, we will read and discuss every page of the Dawn-Breakers, track every character, map every city and essentially rise to the Guardian’s challenge that we “...master and digest the facts recorded therein...” It’s going to be a lot of work and a lot of fun.

Our outcome goals are clear: participants should know the stories and be able to identify the twenty-six key characters — as well as be able to accompany others in reading these important books once they return home.  As the Guardian promised us, “No one can read The Dawn-Breakers and remain cold and unreceptive.” Studying that book is a powerful spiritual journey — a quickening of the soul. It offers a revitalized Bahá’í identity and the inspiration we so badly need to get through these troubled days.

### Where will this be held?

In the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.

### When?

Every month in 2020, beginning with April. We know everyone has different schedules and commitments, so we thought, “Let’s just keep repeating every month, all year! Surely anyone who really wants to attend can find some month that works.”

### Who should attend? (ages 15-112)

Given the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.

### Why should I do this now? (if not now, then when?)

The Guardian assures us that studying the Dawn-Breakers has a profound mystical effect on our dormant spiritual powers. It should not be a surprise therefore that Shoghi Effendi called on all the Baha’is (especially the youth) to master this book as a basis for teaching. He explained that it is not just a book of history, but a book of meditation. And he assured us that studying that book would quicken our dormant energies in a completely new way.

But let’s be honest. It’s a very difficult book, Northern California is far away, 10 days is a lot of time and the demands of our material life fill up our calendars, sometimes years in advance.
Nevertheless, the bicentennial is fast coming. So, if not now, then when?

Whatever your plans are this summer we hope you will change them and join our little mountain retreat for a few days of spiritual adventure.

### What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)

Every student should bring their own copy of the Dawn-Breakers or a tablet or laptop computer with Ocean 2.0 Reader installed [http://bit.ly/ocean-app](/ocean). Books, supplies, bedding, food and all materials are supplied. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.

### How much is it? (about $20/day.)

We're working hard to keep costs as low as possible -- and so far that seems to come to about $20/day for room, board and materials. Our costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting to Sacramento, let us know and we’ll do whatever we can to get you here. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.
