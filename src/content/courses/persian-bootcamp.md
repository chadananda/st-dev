As a folow-up to the intensive Arabic program in May, this late-summer intensive Farsi program will use the same format to plunge the participants into literary Persian. As with the Arabic bootcamp, the mornings will be spent studying key tablets in Farsi (the Íqán, Seven Valleys etc.) while the afternoons will be spent immsersed in Farsi adventure stories to absorbe vocabulary and grammar naturally.

As with the Arabic program, participants will receive a preparation program a couple weeks before the course, this will help you master a set of the most common words and model phrases containing the most common grammatical constructs.

### Where will this be held?

In the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.

### When?

This program is a one-time special event. We may never repeat. The dates are August 15-22




### Who should attend? (ages 15-112)

Given the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.

### What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)

Every student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.

### How much? ($150, or about $30/day.)

We're working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. Our costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting to Sacramento, let us know and we’ll do whatever we can to get you here. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.
