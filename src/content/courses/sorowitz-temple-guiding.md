Thousands of people every day visit Mashriqu’l-Adhkárs around the world, many just as tourists but many others with profound spiritual questions. A handful of guides are involved in answering questions and stimulating curiosity in the souls these seekers. "Teaching in the Mashriqu’l-Adhkár" has broad applications for teaching anywhere in the world. See the wonderful new compilation from the Baha'i World Centre:  [The Institution of the Mashriqu’l-Adhkár](https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.pdf)

Steve Sarowitz is the producer of the feature-length film, “The Gate: Dawn of the Bahá’í Faith” and a long time volunteer teacher at Mashriqu’l-Adhkárs in several countries.

### Where will this be held?

In the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.

### Who should attend? (ages 15+)

Given the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.



### What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)

Every student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.

### How much? ($110)

We’re working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. This program includes three nights lodging and eight meals. As well as transportation to and from the airport, if you are arriving by plane.

Our costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting here, just let us know. We’ll do whatever we can to find a way. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.
