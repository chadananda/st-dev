‘Abdu’l-Bahá in America recounts the journey of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the eldest son of Bahá’u’lláh and appointed head of the Bahá’í Faith after his father's passing, across much of the United States in 1912. His exhausting yet exhilarating 239-day trek from coast to coast took him to fifty cities and towns, where he delivered up to four talks a day -- about four hundred total -- to approximately 93,000 people on Bahá’u’lláh’s message of the oneness of humanity and the principles of universal peace.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá in America recounts the journey of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the eldest son of Bahá’u’lláh and appointed head of the Bahá’í Faith after his father's passing, across much of the United States in 1912. His exhausting yet exhilarating 239-day trek from coast to coast took him to fifty cities and towns, where he delivered up to four talks a day -- about four hundred total -- to approximately 93,000 people on Bahá’u’lláh’s message of the oneness of humanity and the principles of universal peace. This historic visit to the United States planted the seeds that would take root and germinate into the present-day American Bahá’í community.

Robert H. Stockman obtained his Master's degree and doctorate in Religious Studies from Harvard University, where he specialized in history of religion in the United States. He is the author of The Bahá’í Faith in America, volumes 1 and 2, which cover Bahá’í events in the United States from 1892 to 1900 and 1901 to 1912 respectively; Thornton Chase: The First American Bahá’í; various articles and book reviews on Bahá’í history and theology published in a number of journals, including The Journal of Bahá’í Studies, Bahá’í Studies Review, World Order, Iranian Studies, Nova Religio, and Religion; and numerous encyclopedia articles on the Bahá’í Faith, including articles in the Bahá’í Encyclopedia. He has lectured on Bahá’í topics across the United States and in Europe, Russia, Ukraine, and Israel, and is a frequent contributor to Bahá’í panels at the American Academy of Religion.

He has been an instructor of religious studies at DePaul University in Chicago since 1990, where he teaches world religions, religion in the United States, and Islam. He has been Director of the Wilmette Institute since 2000. He has served on the editorial boards of the Bahá’í Encyclopedia Project, Journal of Bahá’í Studies, and World Order magazine. He lives with his wife and two children in South Bend, Indiana. He is currently working on a book, Abdu'l-Baha in America, is under contract to write an introductory book on the Bahá’í Faith, and is researching two other books.

### Where will this be held?

In the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.

### Who should attend? (ages 15+)

Given the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.



### What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)

Every student should bring their tablet or laptop computer. Materials, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.

### How much? ($110, about $30/day.)

We're working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. Our costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting to Sacramento, let us know and we’ll do whatever we can to get you here. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.
