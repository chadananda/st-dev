Have you ever wanted to learn Arabic but don't have years of time to devote to this very difficult task? What if you could spend ten days in an intensive bootcamp and walk away having already read your first novel in Arabic?

Sound impossible? Well, it's not going to be a walk in the park. Learning and using a lot of new vocabulary is an essentially painful process. Your head will definitely hurt. But, if done correctly, your pain will exactly match your gain.

Here's the plan. A couple weeks before the course, you will master a set of flashcards whcih will provide the most common words as well as phrase containing the most common grammatical constructs.

Then, for ten days, we will spend one hour practicing some core texts privately, then two hours discussing those core texts in a workshop. Then another six hours of immersion read-along of Arabic adventure stories.

The core texts for this course are some of the most amazing tablets of Bahá'u'lláh such as the "Tablet of Ahmad", the short and long healing prayers, the short and long Obligatory prayers etc. Our guest teacher, Joshua Hall, will lead us through those tablets exploring key terminology and highlighting helpful grammatical prinicples.

### Where will this be held?

In the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms. If you are not within driving distance, you can fly into the Sacramento Airport (SMF) or take a train to the Sacramento Amtrak train station. Our community volunteers will pick you up and shuttle you to the school. The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.

### When?

This program is a one-time special event. We may never repeat. The dates are

### Who should attend? (ages 15-112)

Given the pace and difficulty of material, only adults and youth 15 or older. Minors will need to be accompanied by a parent or a designated guardian. We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.

### Why should I do this now? (if not now, then when?)

The Guardian assures us that studying the Dawn-Breakers has a profound mystical effect on our dormant spiritual powers. It should not be a surprise therefore that Shoghi Effendi called on all the Baha’is (especially the youth) to master this book as a basis for teaching. He explained that it is not just a book of history, but a book of meditation. And he assured us that studying that book would quicken our dormant energies in a completely new way.

But let’s be honest. It’s a very difficult book, Northern California is far away, 10 days is a lot of time and the demands of our material life fill up our calendars, sometimes years in advance. Nevertheless, the bicentennial of the birth of the Báb is now upon us! So, if not now, then when?

Whatever your current plans are this summer, we hope you will change them and join our little mountain retreat for a few days of spiritual adventure.

### What to Bring? (books, light clothes, shampoo)

Every student should bring their own copy of the Dawn-Breakers or a tablet or laptop computer with [Ocean 2.0 Reader installed →](/ocean). Pens, pencils, notepads, bedding, towels, food etc. are supplied. We have plenty of laundry facilities as well. You may want to bring a swimsuit for occasional outings to the nearby river.

### How much? ($320, about $30/day.)

We're working hard to keep costs as low as possible — and so far that seems to come to about $30 per day for room, board and materials. Our costs are reduced because of the generosity of the community and some very dedicated volunteers. If you need any help getting to Sacramento, let us know and we’ll do whatever we can to get you here. If you’re driving and have extra room for a ride share, let us know.
