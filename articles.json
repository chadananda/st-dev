[applause]</p>\n<p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves [Audience:] (Yeah) who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. (Hmm)</p>\n<p>But one hundred years later (All right), the Negro still is not free. (My Lord, Yeah) One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. (Hmm) One hundred years later (All right), the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later (My Lord) [applause], the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. (Yes, yes) And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.</p>\n<p>In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence (Yeah), they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men (My Lord), would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. (My Lord) Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked insufficient funds. [enthusiastic applause] (My Lord, Lead on, Speech, speech)</p>\n<p>But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. (My Lord) [laughter] (No, no) We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. (Sure enough) And so we’ve come to cash this check (Yes), a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom (Yes) and the security of justice. (Yes Lord) [enthusiastic applause]</p>\n<p>We have also come to this hallowed spot (My Lord) to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. (Mhm) This is no time (My Lord) to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. [applause] (Yes, Speak on it!) Now is the time (Yes it is) to make real the promises of democracy. (My Lord) Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time [applause] to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time (Yes) [applause] (Now) to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.</p>\n<p>It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent (Yes) will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. (My Lord) 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. (Yes) And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. [enthusiastic applause] There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</p>\n<p>But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: in the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. (My Lord, No, no, no, no) [applause] We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. (My Lord) Again and again (No, no), we must rise to the majestic heights (Yes) of meeting physical force with soul force. (My Lord) The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people (Hmm), for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny [sustained applause], and they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.</p>\n<h3>We cannot walk alone</h3>\n<p>We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be satisfied?” (Never) We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. (Yes) We can never be satisfied [applause] as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. [applause] We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. (Yes) We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating for whites only. [applause] (Yes, Hallelujah) We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. (Yeah, That’s right, Let’s go) [applause] No, no, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters (Yes) and righteousness like a mighty stream. [applause] (Let’s go, Tell it)</p>\n<p>I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. (My Lord) Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. (My Lord, That’s right) Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution (Yeah, Yes) and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith (Hmm) that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi (Yeah), go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities (Yes), knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. (Yes) Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. (My Lord)</p>\n<p>I say to you today, my friends [applause], so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow (Uh-huh), I still have a dream. (Yes) It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. (Yes)</p>\n<p>I have a dream (Mhm) that one day (Yes) this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed (Hah): “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.” (Yeah, Uh-huh, Hear hear) [applause]</p>\n<p>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia (Yes, Talk), the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</p>\n<p>I have a dream (Yes) [applause] that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice (Yeah), sweltering with the heat of oppression (Mhm), will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.</p>\n<p>I have a dream (Yeah) [applause] that my four little children (Well) will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. (My Lord) I have a dream today. [enthusiastic applause]</p>\n<p>I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists (Yes, Yeah), with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of “interposition” and “nullification” (Yes), one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. [applause] (God help him, Preach)</p>\n<p>I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted (Yes), every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain (Yes), and the crooked places will be made straight (Yes), and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed [cheering], and all flesh shall see it together. (Yes Lord)</p>\n<p>This is our hope. (Yes, Yes) This is the faith that I go back to the South with. (Yes) With this faith (My Lord) we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. (Yes, All right) With this faith (Yes) we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation (Yes) into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. (Talk about it) With this faith (Yes, My Lord) we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together (Yes), to stand up for freedom together (Yeah), knowing that we will be free one day. [sustained applause]</p>\n<p>This will be the day, this will be the day when all of God’s children (Yes, Yeah) will be able to sing with new meaning: “My country, ‘tis of thee (Yeah, Yes), sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. (Oh yes) Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim’s pride (Yeah), from every mountainside, let freedom ring!” (Yeah)</p>\n<p>And if America is to be a great nation (Yes), this must become true. So let freedom ring (Yes, Amen) from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. (Uh-huh) Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. (Yes, all right) Let freedom ring (Yes) from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado. (Well) Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. (Yes) But not only that: (No) Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. [cheering] (Yeah, Oh yes, Lord) Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. (Yes) Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. (Yes) From every mountainside (Yeah) [sustained applause], let freedom ring.</p>\n<p>And when this happens [applause] (Let it ring, Let it ring), and when we allow freedom ring (Let it ring), when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city (Yes Lord), we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children (Yeah), black men (Yeah) and white men (Yeah), Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics (Yes), will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: “Free at last! (Yes) Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!” [enthusiastic applause]</p>\n","parentDir":"2019-02-11, King - The Dream","baseid":"f7e06598ee","id":"9cdfe9f2c7","slug":"2019-02-10_i-have-a-dream","previnfo":{"id":"9804af95ac","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Essay on the Trinity","slug":"2016-03-10_essay-on-the-trinity","language":"en","author":"Jonathan Edwards","img":"2000px-Society_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Most_Holy_Trinity_badge.svg.png"},"nextinfo":{"id":"d2fb09cd82","tags":"peace,love,non-violence","title":"Tolstoy’s Letter to Ghandi, Law of Love","slug":"2019-02-10_tolstoys-letter-to-ghandi-law-of-love","language":"en","author":"Leo Tolstoy","img":"tolsoy-portrait.jpg"}},{"file":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/articles/2019-02-11, King - The Dream/2019-02-11_King-the-dream_it.md","title":"Ho un sogno","author":"Martin Luther King Jr.","pubdate":"2019-02-10","language":"it","likes":90,"tags":"race,vision","img":"Martin-Luther-King.jpg","category":"racial amity","snip":"E mentre camminiamo, dobbiamo impegnarci a fare sempre marcia avanti.

[applausi]</p>\n<p>Cinque anni fa, un grande americano, nella cui ombra simbolica ci troviamo oggi, ha firmato la proclamazione di emancipazione. Questo importantissimo decreto giunse come un grande faro di speranza a milioni di schiavi negri [Pubblico:] (Sì) che era stato bruciato tra le fiamme dell'ingiusta ingiustizia. Arrivò come un'aurora gioiosa per terminare la lunga notte della loro prigionia. (Hmm)</p>\n<p>Ma cento anni dopo (Va bene), il negro non è ancora libero. (Mio Signore, sì) Cento anni dopo, la vita del negro è ancora tristemente menomata dai manacles della segregazione e dalle catene della discriminazione. (Hmm) Cento anni dopo (Va bene), il negro vive su un'isola solitaria di povertà nel mezzo di un vasto oceano di prosperità materiale. Cento anni dopo (My Lord) [applausi], il negro è ancora languido negli angoli della società americana e si ritrova in esilio nella sua terra. (Sì, sì) E così siamo venuti qui oggi per drammatizzare una condizione vergognosa.</p>\n<p>In un certo senso siamo venuti nella capitale della nostra nazione per incassare un assegno. Quando gli architetti della nostra repubblica scrissero le magnifiche parole della Costituzione e la Dichiarazione di Indipendenza (Sì), firmarono una cambiale alla quale ogni americano doveva essere erede. Questa nota era una promessa che a tutti gli uomini, sì, ai neri e agli uomini bianchi (il mio Signore), sarebbero garantiti i diritti inalienabili della vita, della libertà e della ricerca della felicità. Oggi è ovvio che l'America è venuta meno a questa cambiale per quanto riguarda i suoi cittadini di colore. (Mio Signore) Invece di onorare questo sacro obbligo, l'America ha dato ai negri un cattivo controllo, un assegno che è tornato a segnare fondi insufficienti. [Applausi entusiastici] (Mio Signore, avanti, discorso, discorso)</p>\n<p>Ma ci rifiutiamo di credere che la banca di giustizia sia in bancarotta. (Mio Signore) [risate] (No, no) Rifiutiamo di credere che non ci siano fondi sufficienti nei grandi caveau delle opportunità di questa nazione. (Abbastanza sicuro) E così siamo venuti per incassare questo assegno (Sì), un assegno che ci darà su richiesta la ricchezza della libertà (Sì) e la sicurezza della giustizia. (Sì, Signore) [applauso entusiasta]</p>\n<p>Siamo anche venuti in questo luogo sacro (il mio Signore) per ricordare all'America la feroce urgenza di adesso. (Mhm) Questo non è il tempo (My Lord) per impegnarsi nel lusso di rinfrescarsi o prendere la droga tranquillizzante del gradualismo. [applauso] (Sì, parla!) Ora è il momento (Sì, lo è) per rendere reali le promesse della democrazia. (Mio Signore) Ora è il momento di alzarsi dall'oscura e desolata valle della segregazione al sentiero illuminato dalla luce della giustizia razziale. Ora è il momento [applauso] per sollevare la nostra nazione dalle sabbie mobili dell'ingiustizia razziale alla solida roccia della fratellanza. Ora è il momento (Sì) [applauso] (Ora) per rendere la giustizia una realtà per tutti i figli di Dio.</p>\n<p>Sarebbe fatale per la nazione trascurare l'urgenza del momento. Questa soffocante estate del legittimo malcontento dei negri (Sì) non passerà finché non ci sarà un corroborante autunno di libertà e uguaglianza. (My Lord) 1963 non è un fine, ma un inizio. (Sì) E coloro che sperano che il negro abbia bisogno di sfogarsi e che ora si accontenti avranno un brusco risveglio se la nazione tornerà agli affari come al solito. [Applauso entusiasta] Non ci sarà né riposo né tranquillità in America fino a quando il negro non avrà concesso i suoi diritti di cittadinanza. I turbini di rivolta continueranno a scuotere le fondamenta della nostra nazione fino a quando non emergerà il giorno luminoso della giustizia.</p>\n<p>Ma c'è qualcosa che devo dire al mio popolo, che sta sulla soglia calda che conduce al palazzo della giustizia: nel processo di ottenere il nostro giusto posto, non dobbiamo essere colpevoli di azioni illecite. Non cerchiamo di soddisfare la nostra sete di libertà bevendo dal calice dell'amarezza e dell'odio. (Mio Signore, No, no, no, no) [applausi] Dobbiamo condurre per sempre la nostra lotta sull'alto piano della dignità e della disciplina. Non dobbiamo permettere che la nostra protesta creativa degeneri in violenza fisica. (Mio Signore) Ancora e ancora (No, no), dobbiamo elevarci alle maestose altezze (Yes) di incontrare la forza fisica con la forza dell'anima. (Mio Signore) La meravigliosa nuova militanza che ha travolto la comunità negra non deve condurci a una sfiducia nei confronti di tutti i bianchi (Hmm), poiché molti dei nostri fratelli bianchi, come dimostra la loro presenza qui oggi, hanno capito che i loro il destino è legato al nostro destino [applausi sostenuti] e si sono resi conto che la loro libertà è inestricabilmente legata alla nostra libertà.</p>\n<h3>Non possiamo camminare da soli</h3>\n<p>Non possiamo camminare da soli. E mentre camminiamo, dobbiamo impegnarci a fare sempre marcia avanti. Non possiamo tornare indietro. Ci sono quelli che chiedono ai devoti dei diritti civili: &quot;Quando sarai soddisfatto?&quot; (Mai) Non potremo mai essere soddisfatti finché il negro sarà vittima degli orrori indicibili della brutalità della polizia. (Sì) Non possiamo mai essere soddisfatti [applausi] finché i nostri corpi, carichi della fatica del viaggio, non possono ottenere alloggio nei motel delle autostrade e negli hotel delle città. [applausi] Non possiamo essere soddisfatti finché la mobilità di base del negro va da un ghetto più piccolo a uno più grande. (Sì) Non possiamo mai essere soddisfatti finché i nostri figli sono spogliati della loro individualità e derubati della loro dignità con segni che indicano solo i bianchi. [applausi] (Sì, Alleluia) Non possiamo essere soddisfatti finché un negro in Mississippi non può votare e un negro a New York crede di non avere nulla per cui votare. (Sì, è vero, andiamo) [applauso] No, no, non siamo soddisfatti e non saremo soddisfatti finché la giustizia non si schianta come le acque (Sì) e la giustizia come una potente corrente. [applausi] (Andiamo, dillo)</p>\n<p>Non sono indifferente che alcuni di voi siano venuti qui per grandi prove e tribolazioni. (Mio Signore) Alcuni di voi sono venuti freschi da celle di prigione strette. (Mio Signore, è vero) Alcuni di voi sono venuti da aree in cui la vostra ricerca di libertà vi ha lasciato colpiti dalle tempeste di persecuzione (Sì, Sì) e barcollato dai venti della brutalità della polizia. Siete stati i veterani della sofferenza creativa. Continua a lavorare con la fede (Hmm) che la sofferenza non guadagnata è redentrice. Torna in Mississippi (Yeah), torna in Alabama, torna in Carolina del Sud, torna in Georgia, torna in Louisiana, torna nei bassifondi e nei ghetti delle nostre città del nord (Sì), sapendo che in qualche modo questa situazione può e sarà cambiato. (Sì) Non abbandoniamoci alla valle della disperazione. (Mio Signore)</p>\n<p>Vi dico oggi, miei amici [applausi], quindi anche se affrontiamo le difficoltà di oggi e di domani (Uh-huh), ho ancora un sogno. (Sì) È un sogno profondamente radicato nel sogno americano. (Sì)</p>\n<p>Ho un sogno (Mhm) che un giorno (Sì) questa nazione si leverà e vivrà il vero significato del suo credo (Hah): &quot;Riteniamo che queste verità siano autoevidenti, che tutti gli uomini siano creati uguali.&quot; (Sì, Uh-huh, ascolta ascolta) [applauso]</p>\n<p>Ho un sogno che un giorno sulle colline rosse della Georgia (Yes, Talk), i figli degli ex schiavi ei figli degli ex proprietari di schiavi potranno sedersi insieme al tavolo della fratellanza.</p>\n<p>Ho un sogno (Sì) [applauso] che un giorno persino lo stato del Mississippi, uno stato soffocato dal calore dell'ingiustizia (Sì), soffocante per il calore dell'oppressione (Mhm), sarà trasformato in un'oasi di libertà e giustizia.</p>\n<p>Ho un sogno (Sì) [applauso] che i miei quattro bambini piccoli (Bene) un giorno vivranno in una nazione in cui non saranno giudicati dal colore della loro pelle ma dal contenuto del loro carattere. (Mio Signore) Oggi ho un sogno. [applauso entusiasta]</p>\n<p>Ho un sogno che un giorno giù in Alabama, con i suoi viziosi razzisti (Sì, Sì), con il suo governatore che ha le labbra grondanti con le parole di &quot;interposizione&quot; e &quot;annullamento&quot; (Sì), un giorno proprio lì in Alabama poco i ragazzi neri e le ragazze nere potranno unire le mani ai piccoli bianchi e alle ragazze bianche come sorelle e fratelli. Oggi ho un sogno. [applauso] (Dio lo aiuti, predica)</p>\n<p>Ho un sogno che un giorno ogni valle sarà esaltata (Sì), ogni collina e montagna saranno abbassate, i luoghi accidentati saranno resi chiari (Sì), e i luoghi tortuosi saranno fatti diritti (Sì), e la gloria del Signore sarà rivelata [incoraggiante], e ogni carne la vedrà insieme. (Sì signore)</p>\n<p>Questa è la nostra speranza. (Sì, Sì) Questa è la fede che torno al Sud con. (Sì) Con questa fede (il mio Signore) saremo in grado di estrarre dalla montagna della disperazione una pietra di speranza. (Sì, Va bene) Con questa fede (Sì) saremo in grado di trasformare le allegre discordie della nostra nazione (Sì) in una bellissima sinfonia di fratellanza. (Parlane) Con questa fede (Sì, mio ​​Signore) saremo in grado di lavorare insieme, di pregare insieme, di lottare insieme, di andare in prigione insieme (Sì), di difendere la libertà insieme (Sì), sapendo che saremo liberi un giorno. [applauso sostenuto]</p>\n<p>Questo sarà il giorno, questo sarà il giorno in cui tutti i figli di Dio (Sì, Sì) saranno in grado di cantare con un nuovo significato: &quot;Il mio paese, è di te (Sì, Sì), dolce terra di libertà, di io canto. (Oh sì) Terra in cui sono morti i miei padri, terra dell'orgoglio del pellegrino (Sì), da ogni lato della montagna, risuoni la libertà! &quot;(Si)</p>\n<p>E se l'America deve essere una grande nazione (Sì), questo deve diventare realtà. Quindi lasciate risuonare la libertà (Sì, Amen) dalle colline prodigiose del New Hampshire. (Uh-huh) Lascia che la libertà suoni dalle possenti montagne di New York. Lascia che la libertà suoni dagli allegri Alleghenies della Pennsylvania. (Sì, tutto bene) Lascia suonare la libertà (Sì) dal Rock innevato</p>\n","parentDir":"2019-02-11, King - The Dream","baseid":"f7e06598ee","id":"f0df9ae245","slug":"2019-02-10_ho-un-sogno_it","base":{"id":"9cdfe9f2c7","tags":"race,vision","title":"I have a Dream","slug":"2019-02-10_i-have-a-dream","language":"en","author":"Martin Luther King Jr.","img":"Martin-Luther-King.jpg"},"previnfo":{"id":"47a9a7c740","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Essay on the Trinity IT","slug":"2016-03-10_essay-on-the-trinity-it_it","language":"it","author":"Jonathan Edwards","img":"2000px-Society_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Most_Holy_Trinity_badge.svg.png"},"nextinfo":{"id":"de0eb5b375","tags":"peace,love,non-violence","title":"La lettera di Tolstoj a Gandhi, legge dell'amore.","slug":"2019-02-10_la-lettera-di-tolstoj-a-gandhi-legge-dellamore_it","language":"it","author":"Leo Tolstoy","img":"tolsoy-portrait.jpg"}},{"file":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/articles/2019-02-11, Tolstoy to Ghandi - Law of Love/2019-02-11_Tolstoy-to-Ghandi-law-of-love.md","title":"Tolstoy’s Letter to Ghandi, Law of Love","author":"Leo Tolstoy","pubdate":"2019-02-10","language":"en","likes":88,"tags":"peace,love,non-violence","img":"tolsoy-portrait.jpg","category":"love","snip":"...to demand that all compulsory levying of taxes be discontinued, and all our legal and police institutions, and above all, military institutions, be abolished.","link":"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Correspondence_between_Tolstoy_and_Gandhi","html":"\n<h2>To Mohandas K. Gandhi, Johannesburg, Transvaal, South Africa.</h2>\n<h2>KOCHETY. 7th September 1910.</h2>\n<h3>The renunciation of all Opposition by Force</h3>\n<p>I received your journal, Indian Opinion, and was glad to see what it says of those who renounce all resistance by force, and I immediately felt a wish to let you know what thoughts its perusal aroused in me.</p>\n<p>The longer I live - especially now when I clearly feel the approach of death-the more I feel moved to express what I feel more strongly than anything else, and what in my opinion is of immense importance, namely, what we call the renunciation of all opposition by force, which really simply means the doctrine of the law of love unperverted by sophistries. Love, or in other words the striving of men's souls towards unity and the submissive behaviour to one another that results therefrom, represents the highest and indeed the only law of life, as every man knows and feels in the depths of his heart (and as we see most clearly in children), and knows until he becomes involved in the lying net of worldly thoughts.</p>\n<p>This law was announced by all the philosophies - Indian as well as Chinese, and Jewish, Greek and Roman. Most clearly, I think, was it announced by Christ, who said explicitly that on it hang all the Law and the Prophets. More than that, foreseeing the distortion that has hindered its recognition and may always hinder it, he specially indicated the danger of a misrepresentation that presents itself to men living by worldly interests- namely, that they may claim a right to defend their interests by force or, as he expressed it, to repay blow by blow and recover stolen property by force, etc., etc. He knew, as all reasonable men must do, that any employment of force is incompatible with love as the highest law of life, and that as soon as the use of force appears permissible even in a single case, the law itself is immediately negatived.</p>\n<p>The whole of Christian civilization, outwardly so splendid, has grown up on this strange and flagrant - partly intentional but chiefly unconscious-misunderstanding and contradiction. At bottom, however, the law of love is, and can be, no longer valid if defence by force is set up beside it. And if once the law of love is not valid, then there remains no law except the right of might. In that state Christendom has lived for 1,900 years. Certainly men have always let themselves be guided by force as the main principle of their social order. The difference between the Christian and all other nations is only this: that in Christianity the law of love had been more clearly and definitely given than in any other religion, and that its adherents solemnly recognized it. Yet despite this they deemed the use of force to be permissible, and based their lives on violence - so that the life of the Christian nations presents a greater contradiction between what they believe and the principle on which their lives are built: a contradiction between love which should prescribe the law of conduct, and the employment of force, recognized under various forms-such as governments, courts of justice, and armies, which are accepted as necessary and esteemed. This contradiction increased with the development of the spiritual life of Christianity and in recent years has reached the utmost tension.</p>\n<p>The question now is, that we must choose one of two things-either to admit that we recognize no religious ethics at all but let our conduct of life be decided by the right of might; or to demand that all compulsory levying of taxes be discontinued, and all our legal and police institutions, and above all, military institutions, be abolished.</p>\n<h3>Thou shalt not kill... unless...</h3>\n<p>This spring, at a scripture examination in a Moscow girls' school, first their religious teacher and then an archbishop who was also present, questioned the girls on the ten commandments, especially on the sixth. After the commandments had been correctly recited the archbishop sometimes put a question, usually: 'Is it always and in every case forbidden by the law of God to kill?' And the unfortunate girls, misled by their instructor, had to answer and did answer: 'Not always, for it is permissible in war and at executions.' When, however, this customary additional question - whether it is always a sin to kill - was put to one of these unfortunate creatures (what I am telling you is not an anecdote, but actually happened and was told me by an eyewitness) the girl coloured up and answered decidedly and with emotion - 'Always!' And despite all the customary sophistries of the archbishop, she held steadfastly to it - that to kill is under all circumstances forbidden even in the Old Testament, and that Christ has not only forbidden us to kill, but in general to do any harm to our neighbour. The archbishop, for all his majesty and verbal dexterity, was silenced, and victory remained with the girl.</p>\n<p>Yes, we may write in the papers of our progress in mastery of the air, of complicated diplomatic relation, of various clubs, of discoveries, of all sorts of alliances, and of so-called works of art, and we can pass lightly over what that girl said. But we cannot completely silence her, for every Christian feels the same, however vaguely he may do so. Socialism, Communism, Anarchism' Salvation Armies, the growth of crime, freedom from toil, the increasingly absurd luxury of the rich and increased misery of the poor, the fearfully rising number of suicides-are all indications of that inner contradiction which must and will be resolved. And, of course, resolved in such a manner that the law of love will be recognized and all reliance on force abandoned. Your work in the Transvaal, which to us seems to be at the end of the earth, is yet in the centre of our interest and supplies the most weighty practical proof, in which the world can now share, and not only the Christian but all the peoples of the world can participate.</p>\n<p>I think it will please you to hear that here in Russia, too, a similar movement is rapidly attracting attention, and refusals of military service increase year by year. However small as yet is with you the number of those who renounce all resistance by force, and with us the number of men who refuse any military service-both the one and the other can say: God is with us, and God is mightier than man.</p>\n<p>In the confession of Christianity-even a Christianity deformed as is that taught among us-and a simultaneous belief in the necessity of armies and preparations to slaughter on an ever-increasing scale, there is an obvious contradiction that cries to heaven, and that sooner or later, but probably quite soon, must appear in the light of day in its complete nakedness. That, however, will either annihilate the Christian religion, which is indispensable for the maintenance of the State, or it will sweep away the military and all the use of force bound up with it-which the State needs no less. All governments are aware of this contradiction, your British as much as our Russian, and therefore its recognition will be more energetically opposed by the governments than any other activity inimical to the State, as we in Russia have experienced and as is shown by the articles in your magazine. The governments know from what direction the greatest danger threatens them, and are on guard with watchful eyes not merely to preserve their interests but actually to fight for their very existence.</p>\n<p>Yours etc., LEO TOLSTOY.</p>\n","parentDir":"2019-02-11, Tolstoy to Ghandi - Law of Love","baseid":"46ad0e3be0","id":"d2fb09cd82","slug":"2019-02-10_tolstoys-letter-to-ghandi-law-of-love","previnfo":{"id":"9cdfe9f2c7","tags":"race,vision","title":"I have a Dream","slug":"2019-02-10_i-have-a-dream","language":"en","author":"Martin Luther King Jr.","img":"Martin-Luther-King.jpg"},"nextinfo":{"id":"245f7f89ec","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Developing a Good Heart","slug":"2018-11-17_developing-a-good-heart","language":"en","author":"Dalai Lama","img":"Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg"}},{"file":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/articles/2019-02-11, Tolstoy to Ghandi - Law of Love/2019-02-11_Tolstoy-to-Ghandi-law-of-love_it.md","title":"La lettera di Tolstoj a Gandhi, legge dell'amore.","author":"Leo Tolstoy","pubdate":"2019-02-10","language":"it","likes":88,"tags":"peace,love,non-violence","img":"tolsoy-portrait.jpg","category":"love","snip":"E mentre camminiamo, dobbiamo impegnarci a fare sempre marcia avanti. Non possiamo tornare indietro.","link":"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Correspondence_between_Tolstoy_and_Gandhi","html":"\n<h2>To Mohandas K. Gandhi, Johannesburg, Transvaal, South Africa.</h2>\n<h2>KOCHETY. 7th September 1910.</h2>\n<h3>La rinuncia di tutto l'opposizione alla forza</h3>\n<p>Ho ricevuto il tuo diario, Indian Opinion, e sono stato contento di vedere cosa dice di coloro che rinunciano a ogni resistenza con la forza, e ho subito sentito il desiderio di farti sapere quali pensieri ha suscitato in me la sua lettura.</p>\n<p>Più vivo - specialmente ora che sento chiaramente l'avvicinarsi della morte - più mi sento commosso per esprimere ciò che sento più forte di ogni altra cosa, e ciò che a mio parere è di immensa importanza, cioè quella che chiamiamo la rinuncia ogni opposizione con la forza, che in realtà significa semplicemente la dottrina della legge dell'amore non messa in discussione dai sofismi. L'amore, o in altre parole lo sforzo delle anime degli uomini verso l'unità e il comportamento sottomesso reciproco che ne deriva, rappresenta la più alta ed unica legge della vita, come ogni uomo conosce e sente nel profondo del suo cuore (e come vediamo più chiaramente nei bambini), e lo sa fino a quando non si lascia coinvolgere nella rete di pensieri mondani.</p>\n<p>Questa legge fu annunciata da tutte le filosofie: indiana, cinese, ebraica, greca e romana. Più chiaramente, penso, fu annunciato da Cristo, che disse esplicitamente che su di esso appese tutta la Legge ei Profeti. Inoltre, prevedendo la distorsione che ha ostacolato il suo riconoscimento e che può sempre ostacolarlo, ha indicato in particolare il pericolo di una travisazione che si presenta agli uomini che vivono per interessi mondani, vale a dire che possono rivendicare il diritto di difendere i loro interessi con la forza o, come lo espresse, per ripagare colpo dopo colpo e recuperare proprietà rubate con la forza, ecc., ecc. Sapeva, come tutti gli uomini ragionevoli dovevano fare, che qualsiasi impiego di forza è incompatibile con l'amore come la legge suprema della vita, e che non appena l'uso della forza appare ammissibile anche in un singolo caso, la legge stessa viene immediatamente negata.</p>\n<p>Tutta la civiltà cristiana, esteriormente così splendida, è cresciuta su questa strana e flagrante - in parte intenzionale ma principalmente inconscia - incomprensione e contraddizione. In fondo, tuttavia, la legge dell'amore è, e può essere, non più valida se accanto a essa si crea difesa con la forza. E se una volta che la legge dell'amore non è valida, allora non ci sarà più legge se non il diritto alla forza. In quello stato la cristianità ha vissuto per 1.900 anni. Certamente gli uomini si sono sempre lasciati guidare dalla forza come principio principale del loro ordine sociale. La differenza tra il cristiano e tutte le altre nazioni è solo questa: che nel cristianesimo la legge dell'amore era stata data più chiaramente e definitivamente che in qualsiasi altra religione, e che i suoi aderenti lo riconoscevano solennemente. Nonostante questo, hanno ritenuto ammissibile l'uso della forza e hanno basato la loro vita sulla violenza, in modo che la vita delle nazioni cristiane presenti una maggiore contraddizione tra ciò che credono e il principio su cui si costruiscono le loro vite: una contraddizione tra amore che dovrebbe prescrivere la legge di condotta e l'impiego della forza, riconosciuta sotto varie forme, come i governi, i tribunali e gli eserciti, che sono accettati come necessari e stimati. Questa contraddizione aumentò con lo sviluppo della vita spirituale del cristianesimo e negli ultimi anni ha raggiunto la massima tensione.</p>\n<p>La domanda ora è che dobbiamo scegliere una delle due cose, o ammettere che non riconosciamo alcuna etica religiosa, ma lasciare che la nostra condotta di vita sia decisa dal diritto di forza; o chiedere che venga abolita tutta la riscossione forzata delle tasse, e che tutte le nostre istituzioni legali e di polizia e, soprattutto, le istituzioni militari siano abolite.</p>\n<h3>Non uccidere ... a meno che ...</h3>\n<p>Questa primavera, durante un esame scritturale in una scuola femminile di Mosca, prima il loro insegnante di religione e poi un arcivescovo che era presente, interrogò le ragazze sui dieci comandamenti, specialmente sul sesto. Dopo che i comandamenti erano stati correttamente recitati, l'arcivescovo poneva a volte una domanda, di solito: &quot;È sempre e in ogni caso proibito dalla legge di Dio uccidere?&quot; E le sfortunate ragazze, ingannate dal loro istruttore, dovettero rispondere e risposero: &quot;Non sempre, perché è lecito in guerra e alle esecuzioni&quot;. Quando, tuttavia, questa domanda addizionale consueta - se è sempre un peccato uccidere - è stata messa in una di queste sfortunate creature (quello che sto dicendo non è un aneddoto, ma in realtà è accaduto e mi è stato detto da un testimone oculare) la ragazza colorato e ha risposto in modo deciso e con emozione - &quot;Sempre!&quot; E nonostante tutti i consueti sofismi dell'arcivescovo, ha tenuto con fermezza ad essa - che uccidere è in ogni circostanza vietato anche nell'Antico Testamento, e che Cristo non ci ha solo proibito di uccidere, ma in generale di fare del male ai nostri vicino di casa. L'arcivescovo, per tutta la sua maestà e abilità manuale, fu messo a tacere e la vittoria rimase con la ragazza.</p>\n<p>Sì, potremmo scrivere sui giornali dei nostri progressi nella padronanza dell'aria, di complicate relazioni diplomatiche, di vari club, di scoperte, di ogni sorta di alleanze e di cosiddette opere d'arte, e possiamo passare alla leggera cosa ha detto quella ragazza. Ma non possiamo deliriarla completamente, perché ogni cristiano sente la stessa cosa, per quanto possa farlo vagamente. Socialismo, comunismo, anarchismo &quot;Salvezza Gli eserciti, la crescita del crimine, la libertà dalla fatica, il lusso sempre più assurdo dei ricchi e l'accresciuta miseria dei poveri, il numero spaventosamente crescente di suicidi - sono tutte indicazioni di quella contraddizione interna che deve e vuole essere risolto. E, naturalmente, risolto in modo tale che la legge dell'amore sarà riconosciuta e tutta la dipendenza dalla forza abbandonata. Il tuo lavoro nel Transvaal, che a noi sembra essere alla fine della terra, è ancora al centro del nostro interesse e fornisce la prova pratica più pesante, in cui il mondo può ora condividere, e non solo il cristiano, ma tutti i popoli del mondo possono partecipare.</p>\n<p>Penso che piacerà anche a voi sentire che anche qui in Russia un movimento simile sta rapidamente attirando l'attenzione, e i rifiuti del servizio militare aumentano di anno in anno. Per quanto piccolo sia ancora con te il numero di coloro che rinunciano a ogni resistenza con la forza, e con noi il numero di uomini che rifiutano qualsiasi servizio militare, sia l'uno che l'altro possono dire: Dio è con noi, e Dio è più potente di uomo.</p>\n<p>Nella confessione del cristianesimo - anche un cristianesimo deforme come è quello insegnato tra di noi - e una simultanea convinzione della necessità di eserciti e preparativi da massacrare su una scala sempre crescente, c'è un'ovvia contraddizione che grida al cielo, e che prima o più tardi, ma probabilmente molto presto, deve apparire alla luce del giorno nella sua completa nudità. Ciò, tuttavia, o annienterà la religione cristiana, che è indispensabile per il mantenimento dello Stato, o spazzerà via l'esercito e tutto l'uso della forza legata ad esso - di cui lo Stato non ha bisogno di meno. Tutti i governi sono consapevoli di questa contraddizione, il tuo inglese tanto quanto il nostro russo, e quindi il suo riconoscimento sarà più energicamente opposto dai governi di qualsiasi altra attività nemica allo Stato, come abbiamo sperimentato in Russia e come dimostrato dagli articoli nella tua rivista. I governi sanno da quale direzione il pericolo più grande li minaccia, e stanno in guardia con occhi attenti non solo per preservare i loro interessi ma in realtà per combattere per la loro stessa esistenza.</p>\n<p>Cordiali saluti, LEO TOLSTOY.</p>\n","parentDir":"2019-02-11, Tolstoy to Ghandi - Law of Love","baseid":"46ad0e3be0","id":"de0eb5b375","slug":"2019-02-10_la-lettera-di-tolstoj-a-gandhi-legge-dellamore_it","base":{"id":"d2fb09cd82","tags":"peace,love,non-violence","title":"Tolstoy’s Letter to Ghandi, Law of Love","slug":"2019-02-10_tolstoys-letter-to-ghandi-law-of-love","language":"en","author":"Leo Tolstoy","img":"tolsoy-portrait.jpg"},"previnfo":{"id":"f0df9ae245","tags":"race,vision","title":"Ho un sogno","slug":"2019-02-10_ho-un-sogno_it","language":"it","author":"Martin Luther King Jr.","img":"Martin-Luther-King.jpg"},"nextinfo":{"id":"d299f53dce","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Developing a Good Heart IT","slug":"2018-11-17_developing-a-good-heart-it_it","language":"it","author":"Dalai Lama","img":"Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg"}},{"file":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/articles/2016-03-11, Developing a Good Heart by Dalai-Lama/2016-03-11_Developing-a-Good-Heart-by-Dalai-Lama.md","title":"Developing a Good Heart","author":"Dalai Lama","pubdate":"2018-11-17","language":"en","likes":100,"tags":"sit amet,consectetur","img":"Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg","category":"heart","snip":"I always tell people that my religion is kindness, because kindness is “in our bones.” Without kindness, none of us could survive.

When we are born we are welcomed with kindness and compassion. Due to the kindness of others, we have food, shelter, clothing, and medicine—all that we need to stay alive. As children, under the care of others, we receive an education and learn good values that help us in life. Having enjoyed the benefits of others’ kindness, it is only natural that we repay it.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes our sense of self-interest prevents us from doing so. What’s more, some people say we are genetically predisposed to seek our own benefit regardless of others. I don’t believe we need be confined by such simple instincts. It’s natural for us to pursue our own interests, but we have to do so wisely, not foolishly. And the wise course is to take others into consideration too.</p>\n<p>Today, more and more scientists are finding that consciously cultivating compassion has a positive role in brain function and strengthens particular neural pathways. In other words, our marvelous human brains can be transformed in the process of nurturing our best qualities—such as generosity, compassion, love, tolerance, forgiveness, fortitude, patience, and wisdom. And the ancient methods based on reason that the Buddha taught for releasing disturbing emotions and cultivating positive emotions can provide a way to do this.</p>\n<p>Our world is increasingly interdependent, but I wonder if we truly understand that our interdependent human community has to be compassionate; compassionate in our choice of goals, compassionate in our means of cooperation and our pursuit of these goals. Compassion affirms the principles of dignity and justice for all. From the Buddhist viewpoint all things originate in the mind. Real appreciation of humanity, compassion and love, are the key issues. If we develop a good heart, whether the field is science, commerce or politics, since the motivation is so very important, the result will be more beneficial. With a positive motivation that takes account of other people’s interests as well as our own, our activities can help humanity; without such a motivation our actions are likely to be detrimental. This is why compassion is so very important for humankind.</p>\n","parentDir":"2016-03-11, Developing a Good Heart by Dalai-Lama","baseid":"01873c59aa","id":"245f7f89ec","slug":"2018-11-17_developing-a-good-heart","tagmatches":[{"id":"0e751aa3b8","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Thomas Merton Memoirs about Interfaith","slug":"2016-10-26_thomas-merton-memoirs-about-interfaith","language":"en","author":"Thomas Merton","img":"Dhirendra-Brahmachari.jpeg"},{"id":"3fd17b3349","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"An Indian Folk Religion","slug":"2016-08-13_an-indian-folk-religion","language":"en","author":"Rabindranath Tagore","img":"46122bc4dca93e61413c2e750ca0974b.jpg"},{"id":"a4d7127f1a","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Be Like Adam’s Son","slug":"2016-08-01_be-like-adams-son","language":"en","author":"Jawdat Sa’eed","img":"adam-and-eve-with-the-infants-cain-and-abel-lorenzo-de-ferrari.jpg"},{"id":"9804af95ac","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Essay on the Trinity","slug":"2016-03-10_essay-on-the-trinity","language":"en","author":"Jonathan Edwards","img":"2000px-Society_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Most_Holy_Trinity_badge.svg.png"}],"previnfo":{"id":"d2fb09cd82","tags":"peace,love,non-violence","title":"Tolstoy’s Letter to Ghandi, Law of Love","slug":"2019-02-10_tolstoys-letter-to-ghandi-law-of-love","language":"en","author":"Leo Tolstoy","img":"tolsoy-portrait.jpg"},"nextinfo":{"id":"0e751aa3b8","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Thomas Merton Memoirs about Interfaith","slug":"2016-10-26_thomas-merton-memoirs-about-interfaith","language":"en","author":"Thomas Merton","img":"Dhirendra-Brahmachari.jpeg"}},{"file":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/articles/2016-03-11, Developing a Good Heart by Dalai-Lama/2016-03-11_Developing-a-Good-Heart-by-Dalai-Lama_it.md","title":"Developing a Good Heart IT","author":"Dalai Lama","pubdate":"2018-11-17","language":"it","likes":100,"tags":"sit amet,consectetur","img":"Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg","category":"heart","snip":"Dico sempre alla gente che la mia religione è gentile, perché la gentilezza è \"nelle nostre ossa\".","html":"\n<h1>Sviluppare un buon cuore, dal Dalai Lama</h1>\n<p>Dico sempre alla gente che la mia religione è gentile, perché la gentilezza è &quot;nelle nostre ossa&quot;. Senza gentilezza nessuno di noi potrebbe sopravvivere. Quando nasciamo siamo accolti con gentilezza e compassione. A causa della gentilezza degli altri, abbiamo cibo, riparo, vestiti e medicine, tutto ciò di cui abbiamo bisogno per sopravvivere. Da bambini, sotto la cura degli altri, riceviamo un'educazione e apprendiamo i buoni valori che ci aiutano nella vita. Avendo goduto dei benefici della gentilezza degli altri, è naturale che lo rimborsiamo.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, a volte il nostro senso di interesse personale ci impedisce di farlo. Inoltre, alcune persone dicono che siamo geneticamente predisposti a cercare il nostro beneficio indipendentemente dagli altri. Non credo che abbiamo bisogno di essere confinati da istinti così semplici. È naturale per noi perseguire i nostri interessi, ma dobbiamo farlo in modo saggio, non sciocco. E il saggio è prendere in considerazione anche gli altri.</p>\n<p>Oggi, sempre più scienziati stanno scoprendo che coltivare coscientemente la compassione ha un ruolo positivo nella funzione cerebrale e rafforza percorsi neuronali particolari. In altre parole, i nostri meravigliosi cervelli umani possono essere trasformati nel processo di coltivare le nostre migliori qualità - come la generosità, la compassione, l'amore, la tolleranza, il perdono, la fortezza, la pazienza e la saggezza. E gli antichi metodi basati sulla ragione che il Buddha ha insegnato per rilasciare emozioni disturbanti e coltivare emozioni positive possono fornire un modo per farlo.</p>\n<p>Il nostro mondo è sempre più interdipendente, ma mi chiedo se comprendiamo veramente che la nostra comunità umana interdipendente deve essere compassionevole; compassionevole nella nostra scelta degli obiettivi, compassionevole nei nostri mezzi di cooperazione e nel perseguimento di questi obiettivi. La compassione afferma i principi di dignità e giustizia per tutti. Dal punto di vista buddista tutte le cose hanno origine nella mente. Il vero apprezzamento per l'umanità, la compassione e l'amore, sono le questioni chiave. Se sviluppiamo un buon cuore, sia che si tratti di scienza, commercio o politica, poiché la motivazione è così importante, il risultato sarà più vantaggioso. Con una motivazione positiva che tenga conto degli interessi di altre persone così come delle nostre, le nostre attività possono aiutare l'umanità; senza una tale motivazione le nostre azioni rischiano di essere dannose.

We got along very well together, especially since he sensed that I was trying to feel my way into a settled religious conviction, and into some kind of a life that was centered, as his was, on God. The thing that strikes me now is that he never attempted to explain his own religious beliefs to me – except some of the externals of the cult, and that was later on. He would no doubt told me all that I wanted to know, if I had asked him, but I was not curious enough… He used to tell us how far India was from conversion to Protestantism – or Catholicism for that matter. One of the chief reasons he gave for the failure of any Christian missionaries to really strike deep into the tremendous populations of Asia was the fact that they maintained themselves on a social level that was too far above the natives… all Christian missionaries, according to him, suffered from this big drawback: they lived too well, too comfortably.</p>\n<p>They took care of themselves in a way that simply made it impossible for the Hindus to regard them as holy… According to Bramachari, the prevailing impression among the Hindus seems to be that Christians don’t know what asceticism means. The Hindus are not looking for us to send them men who will build schools and hospitals… they want to know if we have any saints to send them…. the one counsel he did give me is something that I will not easily forget: “There are many beautiful mystical books written by Christians. You should read St. Augustine’s Confessions and The Imitation of Christ.” … “Yes you must read those books.” …Now that I look back on those days, it seems to me very probable that one of the reasons why God had brought him all the way from India, was that he might say just that. After all, it is rather ironical that I had turned, spontaneously to the east, in reading about mysticism, as if there were little or nothing in the Christian tradition… So now I was told that I ought to turn to the Christian tradition, to St. Augustine – and told by a Hindu monk!\n(Thomas Merton, Seven Storey Mountain, pp. 214-217 passim., 1938)</p>\n<h3>Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander</h3>\n<p>Since I am a Catholic, I believe, of course, that my Church guarantees for me the highest spiritual freedom. I would not be a Catholic if I did not believe this…. It is in Christ and in His Spirit that true freedom is found, and the Church is His Body, living by His Spirit. At the same time, this aspiration to spiritual, interior and personal freedom is not foreign to other branches of Christianity and to the other great religions of the world. It is the one thing that all the higher religions have in common (though doubtless on different levels), and it would be no advantage to a Catholic to try to deny this: for what brings out the dignity and grandeur of all religion is by that very fact a point in favor for Catholicism also.</p>\n<p>It is true that in the Catholic Church we believe that we have truly received the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Sonship which makes us free with the freedom of the sons of God. It is true that Protestants make this claim no less firmly, and perhaps indeed it is characteristic of them to make if with great emphasis… How do I know what grace God can and does give to the sincere evangelical Christian who obeys the light of his conscience and follows Christ according to the faith and love he has received? (pp 84 – 85) If I do not have unity in myself, how can I even think, let alone, speak of unity among Christians? Yet, of course, in seeing unity for all Christians, I also attain unity within myself. The heresy of individualism: thinking oneself a completely self-sufficient unit and asserting this imaginary “unity” against all others.</p>\n<p>The affirmation of the self as simply “not the other.” But when I seek to affirm your unity by denying that you have anything to do with anyone else, by negating everyone else in the universe until you come down to you: what is that left to affirm? … The true way is the opposite: by discovering them in myself and myself in them, the more real I am. I am fully real if my own heart says yes to everyone. I will be a better Catholic, not if I can refute every shade of Protestantism, but if I can affirm the truth in it and still go further. So, too, with the Muslims, the Hindus, the Buddhist, etc. This does not mean syncretism, indifferentism, the vapid and careless friendliness that accepts everything by thinking of nothing. There is much that one cannot &quot;affirm&quot; and &quot;accept&quot;, but first one must say &quot;yes&quot; when one really can. If I affirm myself as a Catholic merely by denying all that is Muslim, Jewish, Protestant, Hindu, Buddhist, etc., in the end I will find that there is not much left for me to affirm as a Catholic: and certainly no breath of the Spirit with which to affirm it.

Andavamo molto d'accordo, specialmente perché sentiva che stavo cercando di entrare in una convinta convinzione religiosa, e in una specie di vita centrata, come la sua, su Dio. La cosa che mi colpisce ora è che non ha mai tentato di spiegare le proprie credenze religiose a me - tranne alcuni degli esterni del culto, e che è stato più tardi. Senza dubbio mi avrebbe detto tutto quello che volevo sapere, se gli avessi chiesto, ma non ero abbastanza curioso ... Ci diceva quanto l'India fosse lontana dalla conversione al protestantesimo o al cattolicesimo. Uno dei motivi principali che ha dato per il fallimento di qualsiasi missionario cristiano di colpire davvero in profondità le tremende popolazioni dell'Asia era il fatto che si mantenevano su un livello sociale che era troppo al di sopra dei nativi ... tutti i missionari cristiani, secondo lui , soffriva di questo grosso inconveniente: vivevano troppo bene, troppo comodamente.</p>\n<p>Si sono presi cura di se stessi in un modo che semplicemente rendeva impossibile agli indù considerarli come santi ... Secondo Bramachari, l'impressione prevalente tra gli indù sembra essere che i cristiani non sanno cosa significa l'ascetismo. Gli indù non ci stanno cercando di mandare loro uomini che costruiranno scuole e ospedali ... vogliono sapere se abbiamo dei santi che li mandino ... l'unico consiglio che mi ha dato è qualcosa che non dimenticherò facilmente: &quot;Ci sono molti bei libri mistici scritti dai cristiani. Dovresti leggere le Confessioni di sant'Agostino e l'imitazione di Cristo. &quot;...&quot; Sì, devi leggere quei libri. &quot;... Ora che ripenso a quei giorni, mi sembra molto probabile che uno dei motivi per cui Dio lo abbia portato dall'India, era che avrebbe potuto dire proprio questo. Dopotutto, è piuttosto ironico che mi fossi rivolto, spontaneamente ad est, a leggere sul misticismo, come se ci fosse poco o nulla nella tradizione cristiana ... Così ora mi è stato detto che dovevo rivolgermi alla tradizione cristiana, a Sant'Agostino - e raccontato da un monaco indù!\n(Thomas Merton, Seven Storey Mountain, pp. 214-217 passim., 1938)</p>\n<h3>Thomas Merton, congetture di un colpevole spettatore</h3>\n<p>Dal momento che sono cattolico, credo, naturalmente, che la mia Chiesa mi garantisca la massima libertà spirituale. Non sarei cattolico se non ci credessi ... È in Cristo e nel suo Spirito che si trova la vera libertà, e la Chiesa è il suo corpo, che vive secondo il suo Spirito. Allo stesso tempo, questa aspirazione alla libertà spirituale, interiore e personale non è estranea agli altri rami del cristianesimo e alle altre grandi religioni del mondo. È l'unica cosa che tutte le religioni superiori hanno in comune (anche se senza dubbio a diversi livelli), e non sarebbe vantaggioso per un cattolico tentare di negarlo: perché ciò che mette in risalto la dignità e la grandezza di ogni religione è Davvero un punto a favore anche del cattolicesimo.</p>\n<p>È vero che nella Chiesa cattolica crediamo di aver veramente ricevuto lo Spirito di Dio, lo Spirito di Figliolanza che ci rende liberi dalla libertà dei figli di Dio. È vero che i protestanti fanno questa affermazione non meno fermamente, e forse è proprio loro la caratteristica di fare se con grande enfasi ... Come faccio a sapere quale grazia Dio può e dà al cristiano evangelico sincero che obbedisce alla luce della sua coscienza e segue Cristo secondo la fede e l'amore che ha ricevuto? (pp 84 - 85) Se non ho unità in me stesso, come posso pensare, per non parlare, parlare di unità tra i cristiani? Eppure, naturalmente, vedendo l'unità per tutti i cristiani, raggiungo anche l'unità dentro di me. L'eresia dell'individualismo: pensare di essere un'unità completamente autosufficiente e affermare questa &quot;unità&quot; immaginaria contro tutti gli altri.</p>\n<p>L'affermazione del sé come semplicemente &quot;non l'altro&quot;. Ma quando cerco di affermare la tua unità negando di avere qualcosa a che fare con qualcun altro, negando tutti gli altri nell'universo fino a quando non vieni giù da te: che cos'è lasciato ad affermare? ... La vera via è l'opposto: scoprendoli in me stesso e me stesso, più io sono reale. Sono pienamente reale se il mio cuore dice di sì a tutti. Sarò un cattolico migliore, non se posso smentire ogni sfumatura del protestantesimo, ma se posso affermare la verità in esso e andare oltre. Così anche con i musulmani, gli indù, i buddisti, ecc. Questo non significa sincretismo, indifferentismo, la disinvoltura e la disinvoltura che accetta tutto pensando al nulla. C'è molto che non si può &quot;affermare&quot; e &quot;accettare&quot;, ma prima bisogna dire &quot;si&quot; quando si può veramente. Se mi dichiaro cattolico semplicemente negando tutto ciò che è musulmano, ebreo, protestante, indù, buddista, ecc., Alla fine scoprirò che non mi resta molto da affermare come cattolico: e certamente non respiro dello Spirito con cui affermarlo.

I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.","html":"\n<h2>The miseries of the thraldom of self</h2>\n<p>IN HISTORICAL TIME the Buddha comes first of those who declared salvation to all men, without distinction, as by right man's own. What was the special force which startled men's minds and, almost within the master's lifetime, spread his teachings over India? It was the unique significance of the event, when a man came to men and said to them, ‘I am here to emancipate you from the miseries of the thraldom of self.’ This wisdom came, neither in texts of Scripture, nor in symbols of deities, nor in religious practices sanctified by ages, but through the voice of a living man and the love that flowed from a human heart.</p>\n<p>And I believe this was the first occasion in the history of the world when the idea of the Avatar found its place in religion. Western scholars are never tired of insisting that Buddhism is of the nature of a moral code, coldly leading to the path of extinction. They forget that it was held to be a religion that roused in its devotees an inextinguishable fire of enthusiasm and carried them to lifelong exile across the mountain and desert barriers. To say that a philosophy of suicide can keep kindled in human hearts for centuries such fervour of self-sacrifice is to go against all the laws of sane psychology. The religious enthusiasm which cannot be bound within any daily ritual, but overflows into adventures of love and beneficence, must have in its centre that element of personality which rouses the whole soul. In answer, it may possibly be said that this was due to the personality of Buddha himself. But that also is not quite true. The personality which stirs the human heart to its immense depths, leading it to impossible deeds of heroism, must in the process itself reveal to men the infinite which is in all humanity. And that is what happened in Buddhism, making it a religion in the complete sense of the word.</p>\n<p>Like the religion of the Upanishads, Buddhism also generated two divergent currents; the one impersonal, preaching the abnegation of self through discipline, and the other personal, preaching the cultivation of sympathy for all creatures, and devotion to the infinite truth of love; the other, which is called the Mahayana, had its origin in the positive element contained in Buddha's teachings, which is immeasurable love. It could never, by any logic, find its reality in the emptiness of the truthless abyss. And the object of Buddha's meditation and his teachings was to free humanity from sufferings. But what was the path that he revealed to us? Was it some negative way of evading pain and seeking security against it? On the contrary, his path was the path of sacrifice - the utmost sacrifice of love. The meaning of such sacrifice is to reach some ultimate truth, some positive ideal, which in its greatness can accept suffering and transmute it into the profound peace of self-renunciation. True emancipation from suffering, which is the inalienable condition of the limited life of the self, can never be attained by fleeing from it, but rather by changing its value in the realm of truth - the truth of the higher life of love.</p>\n<p>We have learnt that, by calculations made in accordance with the law of gravitation, some planets were discovered exactly in the place where they should be. Such a law of gravitation there is also in the moral world-And when we find men’s minds disturbed, as they were by the preaching of the Buddha, we can be sure, even without any corroborative evidence, that there must have been some great luminous body of attraction, positive and powerful, and not a mere unfathomable vacancy. It is exactly this which we discover in the heart of the Mahayana system; and we have no hesitation in saying that the truth of Buddhism is there. The oil has to be burnt, not for the purpose of diminishing it, but for the purpose of giving light to the lamp. And when the Buddha said that the self must go, he said at the same moment that love must be realized. Thus originated the doctrine of the Dharma-kaya, the Infinite Wisdom and Love manifested in the Buddha. It was the first instance, as I have said, when men felt that the Universal and the Eternal Spirit was revealed in a human individual whom they had known and touched. The joy was too great for them, since the very idea itself came to them as a freedom - a freedom from the sense of their measureless insignificance. It was the first time I repeat, when the individual, as a man, felt in himself the Infinite made concrete.</p>\n<p>What was more, those men who felt the love welling forth from the heart of Buddhism, as one with the current of the Eternal Love itself, were struck with the idea that such an effluence could never have been due to a single cataclysm of history - unnatural and therefore untrue. They felt instead that it was in the eternal nature of truth, that the event must belong to a series of manifestations; there must have been numberless other revelations in the past and endless others to follow.</p>\n<h3>Infinite Being was already in every one of them</h3>\n<p>The idea grew and widened until men began to feel that this Infinite Being was already in every one of them, and that it rested with themselves to remove the sensual obstructions and reveal him in their own lives. In every individual there was, they realized, the potentiality of Buddha - that is to say, the Infinite made manifest.</p>\n<p>We have to keep in mind the great fact that the preaching of the Buddha in India was not followed by stagnation of life - as would surely have happened if humanity was without any positive goal and his teaching was without any permanent value in itself. On the contrary, we find the arts and sciences springing up in its wake, institutions started for alleviating the misery of all creatures, human and non-human, and great centres of education founded. Some mighty power was suddenly roused from its obscurity, which worked for long centuries and changed the history of man in a large part of the world. And that power came into its full activity only by the individual being made conscious of his infinite worth. It was like the sudden discovery of a great mine of living wealth.</p>\n<p>During the period of Buddhism the doctrine of deliverance flourished, which reached all mankind and released man's inner resources from neglect and self-insult. Even today we see in our own country human nature, from its despised corner of indignity, slowly and painfully finding its way to assert the inborn majesty of man. It is like the imprisoned tree finding a rift in the wall, and sending out its eager branches into freedom, to prove that darkness is not its birthright, that its love is for the sunshine. In the time of the Buddha the individual discovered his own immensity of worth, first by witnessing a man who united his heart in sympathy with all creatures, in all worlds, through the power of a love that knew no bounds; and then by learning that the same light of perfection lay confined within himself behind the clouds of selfish desire, and that the Bodhi-hridaya - ‘the heart of the Eternal Enlightenment’ - every moment claimed its unveiling in his own heart. Nagarjuna speaks of this Bodhi-hridaya (another of whose names is BodhiCitta) as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"noid blockquote\">One who understands the nature of the Bodhi-hridaya, sees everything with a loving heart; for love is the essence of Bodhi-hridaya.' My object in writing this paper is to show, by the further help of illustration from a popular religious sect of Bengal, that the religious instinct of man urges him towards a truth, by which he can transcend the finite nature of the individual self. Man would never feel the indignity of his limitations if these were inevitable. Within him he has glimpses of the Infinite, which give him assurance that this truth is not in his limitations, but that this truth can be attained by love. For love is the positive quality of the Infinite, and love's sacrifice accordingly does not lead to emptiness, but to fulfilment, to Bodhi-hridaya, 'the heart of enlightenment'.</p>\n<p>The members of the religious sect I have mentioned call themselves 'Baul.' They live outside social recognition, and their very obscurity helps them in their seeking, from a direct source, the enlightenment which the soul longs for, the eternal light of love.</p>\n<p>It would be absurd to say that there is little difference between Buddhism and the religion of these simple people, who have no system of metaphysics to support their faith. But my object in bringing close together these two religions, which seem to belong to opposite poles, is to point out the fundamental unity in them. Both of them believe in a fulfilment which is reached by love's emancipating us from the dominance of self. In both these religions we find man's yearning to attain the infinite worth of his individuality, not through any conventional valuation of society, but through his perfect relationship with Truth. They agree in holding that the realization of our ultimate object is waiting for us in ourselves. The Baul likens this fulfilment to the blossoming of a bud, and sings:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Make way, O bud, make way,\nBurst open thy heart and make way.\nThe opening spirit has overtaken thee,\nCanst thou remain a bud any longer? </p>\n<p>One day in a small village in Bengal, an ascetic woman from the neighbourhood came to see me. She had the name 'sarva-khepi' given to her by the village people, the meaning of which is 'the woman who is mad about all things.' She Fixed her star-like eyes upon my face and startled me with the question, 'When are you coming to meet me underneath the trees?' Evidently she pitied me who lived (according to her) prisoned behind walls, banished away from the great meeting-place of the All, where she had her dwelling. Just at that moment my gardener came with his basket, and when the woman understood that the flowers in the vase on my table were going to be thrown away, to make place for the fresh ones, she looked pained and said to me, 'You are always engaged reading and writing; you do not see.' Then she took the discarded flowers in her palms, kissed them and touched them with her forehead, and reverently murmured to herself, 'Beloved of my heart.' I felt that this woman, in her direct vision of the infinite personality in the heart of all things, truly represented the spirit of India.</p>\n<p>In the same village I came into touch with some Baul singers. I had known them by their names, occasionally seen them singing and begging in the street, and so passed them by, vaguely classifying them in my mind under the general name of Vairagis, or ascetics.</p>\n<p>The time came when I had occasion to meet with some members of the same body and talk to them about spiritual matters. The first Baul song, which I chanced to hear with any attention, profoundly stirred my mind. Its words are so simple that it makes me hesitate to render them in a foreign tongue, and set them forward for critical observation. Besides, the best part of a song is missed when the tune is absent; for thereby its movement and its colour are lost, and it becomes like a butterfly whose wings have been plucked.</p>\n<p>The first line may be translated thus: 'Where shall I meet him, the Man of my Heart?' This phrase, 'the Man of my Heart,' is not peculiar to this song, but is usual with the Baul sect. It means that, for me, the supreme truth of all existence is in the revelation of the Infinite in my own humanity.</p>\n<p>'The Man of my Heart,' to the Baul, is like a divine instrument perfectly tuned. He gives expression to infinite truth in the music of life. And the longing for the truth which is in us, which we have not yet realised, breaks out in the following Baul song:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Where shall I meet him, the Man of my Heart?\nHe is lost to me and I seek him wandering from land to land.\nI am listless for that moonrise of beauty,\nwhich is to light my life,\nwhich I long to see in the fulness of vision, in gladness of heart.</p>\n<p>The name of the poet who wrote this song was Gagan. He was almost illiterate; and the ideas he received from his Baul teacher found no distraction from the self-consciousness of the modern age. He was a village postman, earning about ten shillings a month, and he died before he had completed his teens. The sentiment, to which he gave such intensity of expression, is common to most of the songs of his sect. And it is a sect, almost exclusively confined to that lower floor of society, where the light of modern education hardly finds an entrance, while wealth and respectability shun its utter indigence.</p>\n<p>In the song I have translated above, the longing of the singer to realize the infinite in his own personality is expressed. This has to be done daily by its perfect expression in life, in love. For the personal expression of life, in its perfection, is love; just as the personal expression of truth in its perfection is beauty.</p>\n<p>In the political life of the modern age the idea of democracy has given mankind faith in the individual. It gives each man trust in his own possibilities, and pride in his humanity. Something of the same idea, we find, has been working in the popular mind of India, with regard to its religious consciousness. Over and over again it tries to assert, not only that God is for each of us, but also that God is in each of us. These people have no special incarnations in their simple theology, because they know that God is special to each individual. They say that to be born a man is the greatest privilege that can fall to a creature in all the world. They assert that gods in Paradise envy human beings. Why? Because God's will, in giving his love, finds its completeness in man 'swill returning that love. Therefore Humanity is a necessary factor in the perfecting of the divine truth. The Infinite, for its self-expression, comes down into the manifoldness of the Finite; and the Finite, for its self-realization, must rise into the unity of the Infinite. Then only is the Cycle of Truth complete.</p>\n<p>The dignity of man, in his eternal right of Truth, finds expression in the following song, composed, not by a theologian or a man of letters, but by one who belongs to that ninety per cent of the population of British India whose education has been far less than elementary, in fact almost below zero:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">My longing is to meet you in play of love, my Lover;\nBut this longing is not only mine, but also yours.\nFor your lips can have their smile, and your flute\nits music, only in your delight in my love;\nand therefore you are importunate, even as I am.</p>\n<p>If the world were a mere expression of formative forces, then this song would be pathetic in its presumption. But why is there beauty at all in creation - the beauty whose only meaning is in a call that claims disinterestedness as a response? The poet proudly says: 'Your flute could not have its music of beauty if your delight were not in my love. Your power is great - and there I am not equal to you - but it lies even in me to make you smile, and if you and I never meet, then this play of love remains incomplete.' If this were not true, then it would be an utter humiliation to exist at all in this world. If it were solely our business to seek the Lover, and his to keep himself passively aloof in the infinity of his glory, or actively masterful only in imposing his commands upon us, then we should dare to defy him, and refuse to accept the everlasting insult latent in the one-sided importunity of a slave. And this is what the Baul says - he who, in the world of men, goes about singing for alms from door to door, with his one-stringed instrument and long robe of patched-up rags on his back:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">I stop and sit here on the road. Do not ask me to walk farther.\nIf your love can be complete without mine, let me turn back from seeing you.\nI have been travelling to seek you, my friend, for long;\nYet I refuse to beg a sight of you, if you do not feel my need.\nI am blind with market dust and midday glare,\nand so wait, my heart's lover, in hopes that your own love\nwill send you to find me out.  </p>\n<p>The poet is fully conscious that his value in the world's market is pitifully small; that he is neither wealthy nor learned. Yet he has his great compensation, for he has come close to his Lover's heart. In Bengal the women bathing in the river often use their overturned water jars to keep themselves floating when they swim, and the poet uses this incident for his simile:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">It is lucky that I am an empty vessel,\nFor when you swim, I keep floating by your side.\nYour full vessels are left on the empty shore, they are for use;\nBut I am carried to the river in your arms, and I dance to the rhythm of your heart-throbs and heaving of the waves.</p>\n<p>The great distinguished people of the world do not know that these beggars - deprived of education, honour, and wealth - can, in the pride of their souls, look down upon them as the unfortunate ones, who are left on the shore for their worldly uses, but whose life ever misses the touch of the Lover's arms.</p>\n<p>The feeling that man is not a mere casual visitor at the palace-gate of the world, but the invited guest whose presence is needed to give the royal banquet its sole meaning, is not confined to any particular sect in India. Let me quote here some poems from a mediaeval poet of Western India - Jnandas - whose works are nearly forgotten, and have become scarce from the very exquisiteness of their excellence. In the following poem he is addressing God's messenger, who comes to us in the morning light of our childhood, in the dusk of our day's end, and in the night's darkness:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Messenger, morning brought you, habited in gold.\nAfter sunset, your song wore a tune of ascetic grey,\nand then came night.\nYour message was written in bright letters across the black.\nWhy is such splendour about you, to lure the heart of one who is nothing?</p>\n<p>This is the answer of the messenger:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Great is the festival hall where you are to be the only guest.\nTherefore the letter to you is written from sky to sky,\nAnd I, the proud servant, bring the invitation with all ceremony.</p>\n<p>And thus the poet knows that the silent rows of stars carry God's own invitation to the individual soul.</p>\n<p>The same poet sings:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">What hast thou come to beg from the beggar, O King of Kings?\nMy Kingdom is poor for want of him, my dear one, and I wait for him in sorrow.\nHow long will you keep him waiting, O wretch,\nwho has waited for you for ages in silence and stillness?\nOpen your gate, and make this very moment fit for the union.</p>\n<p>It is the song of man's pride in the value given to him by Supreme Love and realized by his own love.</p>\n<p>The Vaishnava religion, which has become the popular religion of India, carries the same message: God's love finding its finality in man's love. According to it, the lover, man, is the complement of the Lover, God, in the internal love drama of existence; and God's call is ever wafted in man's heart in the world-music, drawing him towards the union. This idea has been expressed in rich elaboration of symbols verging upon realism. But for these Bauls this idea is direct and simple, full of the dignified beauty of truth, which shuns all tinsels of ornament.</p>\n<p>The Baul poet, when asked why he had no sect mark on his forehead, answered in his song that the true colour decoration appears on the skin of the fruit when its inner core is filled with ripe, sweet juice; but by artificially smearing it with colour from outside you do not make it ripe. And he says of his Guru, his teacher, that he is puzzled to find in which direction he must make salutation. For his teacher is not one, but many, who, moving on, form a procession of wayfarers.</p>\n<p>Bauls have no temple or image for their worship, and this utter simplicity is needful for men whose one subject is to realize the inner-most nearness of God. The Baul poet expressly says that if we try to approach God through the senses we miss him:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Bring him not into your house as the guest of your eyes;\nbut let him come at your heart's invitation.\nOpening your doors to that which is seen only, is to lose it.</p>\n<p>Yet, being a poet, he also knows that the objects of sense can reveal their spiritual meaning only when they are not seen through mere physical eyes:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Eyes can see only dust and earth,\nBut feel it with your heart, it is pure joy.\nThe flowers of delight blossom on all sides, in every form,\nbut where is your heart's thread to weave them in a garland?</p>\n<p>These Bauls have a philosophy, which they call the philosophy of the body; but they keep its secret; it is only for the initiated. Evidently the underlying idea is that the individual's body is itself the temple, in whose inner mystic shrine the Divine appears before the soul, and the key to it has to be found from those who know. But as the key is not for us outsiders, I leave it with the observation that this mystic philosophy of the body is the outcome of the attempt to get rid of all the outward shelters which are too costly for people like themselves. But this human body of ours is made by God's own hand, from his own love, and even if some men, in the pride of their superiority, may despise it, God Finds his joy in dwelling in others of yet lower birth. It is a truth easier of discovery by these people of humble origin than by men of proud estate.</p>\n<p>The pride of the Baul beggar is not in his worldly distinction, but in the distinction that God himself has given to him. He feels himself like a flute through which God's own breath of love has been breathed:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">My heart is like a flute he has played on.\nIf ever it fall into other hands, -\nlet him fling it away.\nMy lover's flute is dear to him.\nTherefore, if to-day alien breath have entered it and sounded strange notes,\nLet him break it to pieces and strew the dust with them.</p>\n<p>So we find that this man also has his disgust of defilement. While the ambitious world of wealth and power despises him, he in his turn thinks that the world's touch desecrates him who has been made sacred by the touch of his Lover. He does not envy us our life of ambition and achievements, but he knows how precious his own life has been:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">I am poured forth in living notes of joy and sorrow\nby your breath.\nMorning and evening, in summer and in rains, I am\nfashioned to music.\nYet should I be wholly spent in some flight of song,\nI shall not grieve, the tune is so precious to me.</p>\n<p>Our joys and sorrows are contradictory when self separates them in opposition. But for the heart in which self merges in God's love, they lose their absoluteness. So the Baul's prayer is to feel in all situations - in danger, or pain, or sorrow - that he is in God's hands. He solves the problem of emancipation from sufferings by accepting and setting them in a higher context:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">I am the boat, you are the sea, and also the boatman.\nThough you never make the shore, though you let me sink, why should I be foolish and afraid?\nIs the reaching the shore a greater prize than losing myself with you?\nIf you are only the haven, as they say, then what is the sea?\nLet it surge and toss me on its waves, I shall be content.\nI live in you, whatever and however you appear.\nSave me or kill me as you wish, only never leave me in others' hands.</p>\n<p>It is needless to say, before I conclude, that I had neither the training nor the opportunity to study this mendicant religious sect in Bengal from an ethnological standpoint. I was attracted to Find out how the living currents of religious movements work in the heart of the people, saving them from degradation imposed by the society of the learned, of the rich, or of the highborn; how the spirit of man, by making use even of its obstacles, reaches fulfilment, led thither, not by the learned authorities in the scriptures, or by the mechanical impulse of the dogma-driven crowd, but by the unsophisticated aspiration of the loving soul. On the inaccessible mountain peaks of theology the snows of creed remain eternally rigid, cold, and pure. But God's manifest shower falls direct on the plain of humble hearts, flowing there in various channels, even getting mixed with some mud in its course, as it is soaked into the underground currents, invisible, but ever-moving.</p>\n<p>I can think of nothing better than to conclude my paper with a poem of Jnandas, in which the aspiration of all simple spirits has found a devout expression:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">I had travelled all day and was tired; then I bowed my head towards thy kingly court still far away.\nThe night deepened, a longing burned in my heart.\nWhatever the words I sang, pain cried through them - for even my songs thirsted -\nO my Lover, my Beloved, my Best in all the world.\nWhen time seemed lost in darkness,\nthy hand dropped its sceptre to take up the lute and strike the uttermost chords;\nAnd my heart sang out,\nO my Lover, my Beloved, my Best in all the world.\nAh, who is this whose arms enfold me?\nWhatever I have to leave, let me leave; and whatever I have to bear, let me bear.\nOnly let me walk with thee,\nO my Lover, my Beloved, my Best in all the world.\nDescend at whiles from thy high audience hall, come down amid joys and sorrows.\nHide in all forms and delights, in love,\nAnd in my heart sing thy songs, -\nO my Lover, my Beloved, my Best in all the world.</p>\n","parentDir":"2016-08-14, An Indian Folk Religion","baseid":"cdcd64f31a","id":"3fd17b3349","slug":"2016-08-13_an-indian-folk-religion","tagmatches":[{"id":"245f7f89ec","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Developing a Good Heart","slug":"2018-11-17_developing-a-good-heart","language":"en","author":"Dalai Lama","img":"Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg"},{"id":"0e751aa3b8","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Thomas Merton Memoirs about Interfaith","slug":"2016-10-26_thomas-merton-memoirs-about-interfaith","language":"en","author":"Thomas Merton","img":"Dhirendra-Brahmachari.jpeg"},{"id":"a4d7127f1a","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Be Like Adam’s Son","slug":"2016-08-01_be-like-adams-son","language":"en","author":"Jawdat Sa’eed","img":"adam-and-eve-with-the-infants-cain-and-abel-lorenzo-de-ferrari.jpg"},{"id":"9804af95ac","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Essay on the Trinity","slug":"2016-03-10_essay-on-the-trinity","language":"en","author":"Jonathan Edwards","img":"2000px-Society_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Most_Holy_Trinity_badge.svg.png"}],"previnfo":{"id":"0e751aa3b8","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Thomas Merton Memoirs about Interfaith","slug":"2016-10-26_thomas-merton-memoirs-about-interfaith","language":"en","author":"Thomas Merton","img":"Dhirendra-Brahmachari.jpeg"},"nextinfo":{"id":"1d2f3b9192","tags":"enlightenment,civilization","title":"On Enlightening the Mind","slug":"2016-08-13_on-enlightening-the-mind","language":"en","author":"Moses Mendelssohn","img":"What-if-Artificial-Intelligence-Was-Enlightened-1038x583.jpg"}},{"file":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/articles/2016-08-14, An Indian Folk Religion/2016-08-14_An-Indian-Folk-Religion_it.md","title":"An Indian Folk Religion IT","author":"Rabindranath Tagore","pubdate":"2016-08-13","language":"it","likes":12,"tags":"tagore,buddha","img":"46122bc4dca93e61413c2e750ca0974b.jpg","category":"buddhism","snip":"NEL TEMPO STORICO il Buddha viene prima di coloro che hanno dichiarato la salvezza a tutti gli uomini, senza distinzione, come per diritto dell'uomo stesso.","html":"\n<p>NEL TEMPO STORICO il Buddha viene prima di coloro che hanno dichiarato la salvezza a tutti gli uomini, senza distinzione, come per diritto dell'uomo stesso. Qual è stata la forza speciale che ha spaventato la mente degli uomini e, quasi nella vita del maestro, ha diffuso i suoi insegnamenti sull'India? Era il significato unico dell'evento, quando un uomo venne dagli uomini e disse loro: &quot;Sono qui per emanciparti dalle miserie del trionfo del sé&quot;. Questa saggezza arrivò, né nei testi della Scrittura, né nei simboli di divinità, né in pratiche religiose santificate da secoli, ma attraverso la voce di un uomo vivente e l'amore che scorreva da un cuore umano.</p>\n<p>E credo che questa sia stata la prima occasione nella storia del mondo quando l'idea dell'Avatar ha trovato il suo posto nella religione. Gli studiosi occidentali non si stancano mai di insistere sul fatto che il buddismo sia della natura di un codice morale, conducendo freddamente alla via dell'estinzione. Dimenticano che è stata ritenuta una religione che ha suscitato nei suoi devoti un fuoco inestinguibile di entusiasmo e li ha portati in esilio per tutta la vita attraverso le barriere montuose e desertiche. Per dire che una filosofia del suicidio può rimanere accesa nei cuori umani per secoli, tale fervore di auto-sacrificio è di andare contro tutte le leggi della psicologia sana. L'entusiasmo religioso che non può essere legato a nessun rituale quotidiano, ma trabocca in avventure di amore e beneficenza, deve avere al suo centro quell'elemento di personalità che risveglia l'intera anima. In risposta, si può forse dire che ciò è dovuto alla personalità dello stesso Buddha. Ma anche questo non è del tutto vero. La personalità che suscita il cuore umano nelle sue immense profondità, conducendola a fatti impossibili di eroismo, deve nel processo stesso rivelare agli uomini l'infinito che è in tutta l'umanità. E questo è quello che è successo nel buddismo, facendolo diventare una religione nel senso più completo del termine.</p>\n<p>Come la religione delle Upanishad, anche il Buddhismo generò due correnti divergenti; l'unico impersonale, che predica l'abnegazione di sé attraverso la disciplina, e l'altro personale, che predica la coltivazione della simpatia per tutte le creature e la devozione all'infinita verità dell'amore; l'altro, che è chiamato Mahayana, ha avuto origine nell'elemento positivo contenuto negli insegnamenti del Buddha, che è un amore incommensurabile. Non potrebbe mai, in nessuna logica, trovare la sua realtà nel vuoto dell'abisso senza verità. E l'oggetto della meditazione del Buddha e dei suoi insegnamenti era liberare l'umanità dalle sofferenze. Ma qual era il percorso che ci ha rivelato? Era un modo negativo di eludere il dolore e cercare sicurezza contro di esso? Al contrario, il suo percorso era la via del sacrificio - il massimo sacrificio dell'amore. Il significato di tale sacrificio è raggiungere una verità ultima, un ideale positivo, che nella sua grandezza può accettare la sofferenza e trasmutarla nella profonda pace della rinuncia. La vera emancipazione dalla sofferenza, che è la condizione inalienabile della vita limitata del sé, non può mai essere raggiunta fuggendo da essa, ma piuttosto cambiando il suo valore nel regno della verità - la verità della vita superiore dell'amore.</p>\n<p>We have learnt that, by calculations made in accordance with the law of gravitation, some planets were discovered exactly in the place where they should be. Such a law of gravitation there is also in the moral world-And when we find men’s minds disturbed, as they were by the preaching of the Buddha, we can be sure, even without any corroborative evidence, that there must have been some great luminous body of attraction, positive and powerful, and not a mere unfathomable vacancy. It is exactly this which we discover in the heart of the Mahayana system; and we have no hesitation in saying that the truth of Buddhism is there. The oil has to be burnt, not for the purpose of diminishing it, but for the purpose of giving light to the lamp. And when the Buddha said that the self must go, he said at the same moment that love must be realized. Thus originated the doctrine of the Dharma-kaya, the Infinite Wisdom and Love manifested in the Buddha. It was the first instance, as I have said, when men felt that the Universal and the Eternal Spirit was revealed in a human individual whom they had known and touched. The joy was too great for them, since the very idea itself came to them as a freedom - a freedom from the sense of their measureless insignificance. It was the first time I repeat, when the individual, as a man, felt in himself the Infinite made concrete.</p>\n<p>What was more, those men who felt the love welling forth from the heart of Buddhism, as one with the current of the Eternal Love itself, were struck with the idea that such an effluence could never have been due to a single cataclysm of history - unnatural and therefore untrue. They felt instead that it was in the eternal nature of truth, that the event must belong to a series of manifestations; there must have been numberless other revelations in the past and endless others to follow.</p>\n<p>The idea grew and widened until men began to feel that this Infinite Being was already in every one of them, and that it rested with themselves to remove the sensual obstructions and reveal him in their own lives. In every individual there was, they realized, the potentiality of Buddha - that is to say, the Infinite made manifest.</p>\n<p>We have to keep in mind the great fact that the preaching of the Buddha in India was not followed by stagnation of life - as would surely have happened if humanity was without any positive goal and his teaching was without any permanent value in itself. On the contrary, we find the arts and sciences springing up in its wake, institutions started for alleviating the misery of all creatures, human and non-human, and great centres of education founded. Some mighty power was suddenly roused from its obscurity, which worked for long centuries and changed the history of man in a large part of the world. And that power came into its full activity only by the individual being made conscious of his infinite worth. It was like the sudden discovery of a great mine of living wealth.</p>\n<p>During the period of Buddhism the doctrine of deliverance flourished, which reached all mankind and released man's inner resources from neglect and self-insult. Even today we see in our own country human nature, from its despised corner of indignity, slowly and painfully finding its way to assert the inborn majesty of man. It is like the imprisoned tree finding a rift in the wall, and sending out its eager branches into freedom, to prove that darkness is not its birthright, that its love is for the sunshine. In the time of the Buddha the individual discovered his own immensity of worth, first by witnessing a man who united his heart in sympathy with all creatures, in all worlds, through the power of a love that knew no bounds; and then by learning that the same light of perfection lay confined within himself behind the clouds of selfish desire, and that the Bodhi-hridaya - ‘the heart of the Eternal Enlightenment’ - every moment claimed its unveiling in his own heart. Nagarjuna speaks of this Bodhi-hridaya (another of whose names is BodhiCitta) as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"noid blockquote\">One who understands the nature of the Bodhi-hridaya, sees everything with a loving heart; for love is the essence of Bodhi-hridaya.' My object in writing this paper is to show, by the further help of illustration from a popular religious sect of Bengal, that the religious instinct of man urges him towards a truth, by which he can transcend the finite nature of the individual self. Man would never feel the indignity of his limitations if these were inevitable. Within him he has glimpses of the Infinite, which give him assurance that this truth is not in his limitations, but that this truth can be attained by love. For love is the positive quality of the Infinite, and love's sacrifice accordingly does not lead to emptiness, but to fulfilment, to Bodhi-hridaya, 'the heart of enlightenment'.</p>\n<p>The members of the religious sect I have mentioned call themselves 'Baul.' They live outside social recognition, and their very obscurity helps them in their seeking, from a direct source, the enlightenment which the soul longs for, the eternal light of love.</p>\n<p>It would be absurd to say that there is little difference between Buddhism and the religion of these simple people, who have no system of metaphysics to support their faith. But my object in bringing close together these two religions, which seem to belong to opposite poles, is to point out the fundamental unity in them. Both of them believe in a fulfilment which is reached by love's emancipating us from the dominance of self. In both these religions we find man's yearning to attain the infinite worth of his individuality, not through any conventional valuation of society, but through his perfect relationship with Truth. They agree in holding that the realization of our ultimate object is waiting for us in ourselves. The Baul likens this fulfilment to the blossoming of a bud, and sings:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Make way, O bud, make way,\nBurst open thy heart and make way.\nThe opening spirit has overtaken thee,\nCanst thou remain a bud any longer? </p>\n<p>One day in a small village in Bengal, an ascetic woman from the neighbourhood came to see me. She had the name 'sarva-khepi' given to her by the village people, the meaning of which is 'the woman who is mad about all things.' She Fixed her star-like eyes upon my face and startled me with the question, 'When are you coming to meet me underneath the trees?' Evidently she pitied me who lived (according to her) prisoned behind walls, banished away from the great meeting-place of the All, where she had her dwelling. Just at that moment my gardener came with his basket, and when the woman understood that the flowers in the vase on my table were going to be thrown away, to make place for the fresh ones, she looked pained and said to me, 'You are always engaged reading and writing; you do not see.' Then she took the discarded flowers in her palms, kissed them and touched them with her forehead, and reverently murmured to herself, 'Beloved of my heart.' I felt that this woman, in her direct vision of the infinite personality in the heart of all things, truly represented the spirit of India.</p>\n<p>In the same village I came into touch with some Baul singers. I had known them by their names, occasionally seen them singing and begging in the street, and so passed them by, vaguely classifying them in my mind under the general name of Vairagis, or ascetics.</p>\n<p>The time came when I had occasion to meet with some members of the same body and talk to them about spiritual matters. The first Baul song, which I chanced to hear with any attention, profoundly stirred my mind. Its words are so simple that it makes me hesitate to render them in a foreign tongue, and set them forward for critical observation. Besides, the best part of a song is missed when the tune is absent; for thereby its movement and its colour are lost, and it becomes like a butterfly whose wings have been plucked.</p>\n<p>The first line may be translated thus: 'Where shall I meet him, the Man of my Heart?' This phrase, 'the Man of my Heart,' is not peculiar to this song, but is usual with the Baul sect. It means that, for me, the supreme truth of all existence is in the revelation of the Infinite in my own humanity.</p>\n<p>'The Man of my Heart,' to the Baul, is like a divine instrument perfectly tuned. He gives expression to infinite truth in the music of life. And the longing for the truth which is in us, which we have not yet realised, breaks out in the following Baul song:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Where shall I meet him, the Man of my Heart?\nHe is lost to me and I seek him wandering from land to land.\nI am listless for that moonrise of beauty,\nwhich is to light my life,\nwhich I long to see in the fulness of vision, in gladness of heart.</p>\n<p>The name of the poet who wrote this song was Gagan. He was almost illiterate; and the ideas he received from his Baul teacher found no distraction from the self-consciousness of the modern age. He was a village postman, earning about ten shillings a month, and he died before he had completed his teens. The sentiment, to which he gave such intensity of expression, is common to most of the songs of his sect. And it is a sect, almost exclusively confined to that lower floor of society, where the light of modern education hardly finds an entrance, while wealth and respectability shun its utter indigence.</p>\n<p>In the song I have translated above, the longing of the singer to realize the infinite in his own personality is expressed. This has to be done daily by its perfect expression in life, in love. For the personal expression of life, in its perfection, is love; just as the personal expression of truth in its perfection is beauty.</p>\n<p>In the political life of the modern age the idea of democracy has given mankind faith in the individual. It gives each man trust in his own possibilities, and pride in his humanity. Something of the same idea, we find, has been working in the popular mind of India, with regard to its religious consciousness. Over and over again it tries to assert, not only that God is for each of us, but also that God is in each of us. These people have no special incarnations in their simple theology, because they know that God is special to each individual. They say that to be born a man is the greatest privilege that can fall to a creature in all the world. They assert that gods in Paradise envy human beings. Why? Because God's will, in giving his love, finds its completeness in man 'swill returning that love. Therefore Humanity is a necessary factor in the perfecting of the divine truth. The Infinite, for its self-expression, comes down into the manifoldness of the Finite; and the Finite, for its self-realization, must rise into the unity of the Infinite. Then only is the Cycle of Truth complete.</p>\n<p>The dignity of man, in his eternal right of Truth, finds expression in the following song, composed, not by a theologian or a man of letters, but by one who belongs to that ninety per cent of the population of British India whose education has been far less than elementary, in fact almost below zero:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">My longing is to meet you in play of love, my Lover;\nBut this longing is not only mine, but also yours.\nFor your lips can have their smile, and your flute\nits music, only in your delight in my love;\nand therefore you are importunate, even as I am.</p>\n<p>If the world were a mere expression of formative forces, then this song would be pathetic in its presumption. But why is there beauty at all in creation - the beauty whose only meaning is in a call that claims disinterestedness as a response? The poet proudly says: 'Your flute could not have its music of beauty if your delight were not in my love. Your power is great - and there I am not equal to you - but it lies even in me to make you smile, and if you and I never meet, then this play of love remains incomplete.' If this were not true, then it would be an utter humiliation to exist at all in this world. If it were solely our business to seek the Lover, and his to keep himself passively aloof in the infinity of his glory, or actively masterful only in imposing his commands upon us, then we should dare to defy him, and refuse to accept the everlasting insult latent in the one-sided importunity of a slave. And this is what the Baul says - he who, in the world of men, goes about singing for alms from door to door, with his one-stringed instrument and long robe of patched-up rags on his back:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">I stop and sit here on the road. Do not ask me to walk farther.\nIf your love can be complete without mine, let me turn back from seeing you.\nI have been travelling to seek you, my friend, for long;\nYet I refuse to beg a sight of you, if you do not feel my need.\nI am blind with market dust and midday glare,\nand so wait, my heart's lover, in hopes that your own love\nwill send you to find me out.  </p>\n<p>The poet is fully conscious that his value in the world's market is pitifully small; that he is neither wealthy nor learned. Yet he has his great compensation, for he has come close to his Lover's heart. In Bengal the women bathing in the river often use their overturned water jars to keep themselves floating when they swim, and the poet uses this incident for his simile:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">It is lucky that I am an empty vessel,\nFor when you swim, I keep floating by your side.\nYour full vessels are left on the empty shore, they are for use;\nBut I am carried to the river in your arms, and I dance to the rhythm of your heart-throbs and heaving of the waves.</p>\n<p>The great distinguished people of the world do not know that these beggars - deprived of education, honour, and wealth - can, in the pride of their souls, look down upon them as the unfortunate ones, who are left on the shore for their worldly uses, but whose life ever misses the touch of the Lover's arms.</p>\n<p>The feeling that man is not a mere casual visitor at the palace-gate of the world, but the invited guest whose presence is needed to give the royal banquet its sole meaning, is not confined to any particular sect in India. Let me quote here some poems from a mediaeval poet of Western India - Jnandas - whose works are nearly forgotten, and have become scarce from the very exquisiteness of their excellence. In the following poem he is addressing God's messenger, who comes to us in the morning light of our childhood, in the dusk of our day's end, and in the night's darkness:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Messenger, morning brought you, habited in gold.\nAfter sunset, your song wore a tune of ascetic grey,\nand then came night.\nYour message was written in bright letters across the black.\nWhy is such splendour about you, to lure the heart of one who is nothing?</p>\n<p>This is the answer of the messenger:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Great is the festival hall where you are to be the only guest.\nTherefore the letter to you is written from sky to sky,\nAnd I, the proud servant, bring the invitation with all ceremony.</p>\n<p>And thus the poet knows that the silent rows of stars carry God's own invitation to the individual soul.</p>\n<p>The same poet sings:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">What hast thou come to beg from the beggar, O King of Kings?\nMy Kingdom is poor for want of him, my dear one, and I wait for him in sorrow.\nHow long will you keep him waiting, O wretch,\nwho has waited for you for ages in silence and stillness?\nOpen your gate, and make this very moment fit for the union.</p>\n<p>It is the song of man's pride in the value given to him by Supreme Love and realized by his own love.</p>\n<p>The Vaishnava religion, which has become the popular religion of India, carries the same message: God's love finding its finality in man's love. According to it, the lover, man, is the complement of the Lover, God, in the internal love drama of existence; and God's call is ever wafted in man's heart in the world-music, drawing him towards the union. This idea has been expressed in rich elaboration of symbols verging upon realism. But for these Bauls this idea is direct and simple, full of the dignified beauty of truth, which shuns all tinsels of ornament.</p>\n<p>The Baul poet, when asked why he had no sect mark on his forehead, answered in his song that the true colour decoration appears on the skin of the fruit when its inner core is filled with ripe, sweet juice; but by artificially smearing it with colour from outside you do not make it ripe. And he says of his Guru, his teacher, that he is puzzled to find in which direction he must make salutation. For his teacher is not one, but many, who, moving on, form a procession of wayfarers.</p>\n<p>Bauls have no temple or image for their worship, and this utter simplicity is needful for men whose one subject is to realize the inner-most nearness of God. The Baul poet expressly says that if we try to approach God through the senses we miss him:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Bring him not into your house as the guest of your eyes;\nbut let him come at your heart's invitation.\nOpening your doors to that which is seen only, is to lose it.</p>\n<p>Yet, being a poet, he also knows that the objects of sense can reveal their spiritual meaning only when they are not seen through mere physical eyes:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">Eyes can see only dust and earth,\nBut feel it with your heart, it is pure joy.\nThe flowers of delight blossom on all sides, in every form,\nbut where is your heart's thread to weave them in a garland?</p>\n<p>These Bauls have a philosophy, which they call the philosophy of the body; but they keep its secret; it is only for the initiated. Evidently the underlying idea is that the individual's body is itself the temple, in whose inner mystic shrine the Divine appears before the soul, and the key to it has to be found from those who know. But as the key is not for us outsiders, I leave it with the observation that this mystic philosophy of the body is the outcome of the attempt to get rid of all the outward shelters which are too costly for people like themselves. But this human body of ours is made by God's own hand, from his own love, and even if some men, in the pride of their superiority, may despise it, God Finds his joy in dwelling in others of yet lower birth. It is a truth easier of discovery by these people of humble origin than by men of proud estate.</p>\n<p>The pride of the Baul beggar is not in his worldly distinction, but in the distinction that God himself has given to him. He feels himself like a flute through which God's own breath of love has been breathed:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">My heart is like a flute he has played on.\nIf ever it fall into other hands, -\nlet him fling it away.\nMy lover's flute is dear to him.\nTherefore, if to-day alien breath have entered it and sounded strange notes,\nLet him break it to pieces and strew the dust with them.</p>\n<p>So we find that this man also has his disgust of defilement. While the ambitious world of wealth and power despises him, he in his turn thinks that the world's touch desecrates him who has been made sacred by the touch of his Lover. He does not envy us our life of ambition and achievements, but he knows how precious his own life has been:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">I am poured forth in living notes of joy and sorrow\nby your breath.\nMorning and evening, in summer and in rains, I am\nfashioned to music.\nYet should I be wholly spent in some flight of song,\nI shall not grieve, the tune is so precious to me.</p>\n<p>Our joys and sorrows are contradictory when self separates them in opposition. But for the heart in which self merges in God's love, they lose their absoluteness. So the Baul's prayer is to feel in all situations - in danger, or pain, or sorrow - that he is in God's hands. He solves the problem of emancipation from sufferings by accepting and setting them in a higher context:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">I am the boat, you are the sea, and also the boatman.\nThough you never make the shore, though you let me sink, why should I be foolish and afraid?\nIs the reaching the shore a greater prize than losing myself with you?\nIf you are only the haven, as they say, then what is the sea?\nLet it surge and toss me on its waves, I shall be content.\nI live in you, whatever and however you appear.\nSave me or kill me as you wish, only never leave me in others' hands.</p>\n<p>It is needless to say, before I conclude, that I had neither the training nor the opportunity to study this mendicant religious sect in Bengal from an ethnological standpoint. I was attracted to Find out how the living currents of religious movements work in the heart of the people, saving them from degradation imposed by the society of the learned, of the rich, or of the highborn; how the spirit of man, by making use even of its obstacles, reaches fulfilment, led thither, not by the learned authorities in the scriptures, or by the mechanical impulse of the dogma-driven crowd, but by the unsophisticated aspiration of the loving soul. On the inaccessible mountain peaks of theology the snows of creed remain eternally rigid, cold, and pure. But God's manifest shower falls direct on the plain of humble hearts, flowing there in various channels, even getting mixed with some mud in its course, as it is soaked into the underground currents, invisible, but ever-moving.</p>\n<p>I can think of nothing better than to conclude my paper with a poem of Jnandas, in which the aspiration of all simple spirits has found a devout expression:</p>\n<p class=\"verse noid blockquote\">I had travelled all day and was tired; then I bowed my head towards thy kingly court still far away.\nThe night deepened, a longing burned in my heart.\nWhatever the words I sang, pain cried through them - for even my songs thirsted -\nO my Lover, my Beloved, my Best in all the world.\nWhen time seemed lost in darkness,\nthy hand dropped its sceptre to take up the lute and strike the uttermost chords;\nAnd my heart sang out,\nO my Lover, my Beloved, my Best in all the world.\nAh, who is this whose arms enfold me?\nWhatever I have to leave, let me leave; and whatever I have to bear, let me bear.\nOnly let me walk with thee,\nO my Lover, my Beloved, my Best in all the world.\nDescend at whiles from thy high audience hall, come down amid joys and sorrows.\nHide in all forms and delights, in love,\nAnd in my heart sing thy songs, -\nO my Lover, my Beloved, my Best in all the world.</p>\n","parentDir":"2016-08-14, An Indian Folk Religion","baseid":"cdcd64f31a","id":"963f987568","slug":"2016-08-13_an-indian-folk-religion-it_it","base":{"id":"3fd17b3349","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"An Indian Folk Religion","slug":"2016-08-13_an-indian-folk-religion","language":"en","author":"Rabindranath Tagore","img":"46122bc4dca93e61413c2e750ca0974b.jpg"},"previnfo":{"id":"9a1dfc5410","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Thomas Merton Memoirs about Interfaith IT","slug":"2016-10-26_thomas-merton-memoirs-about-interfaith-it_it","language":"it","author":"Thomas Merton","img":"Dhirendra-Brahmachari.jpeg"},"nextinfo":{"id":"aef757839a","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"On Enlightening the Mind IT","slug":"2016-08-13_on-enlightening-the-mind-it_it","language":"it","author":"Moses Mendelssohn","img":"What-if-Artificial-Intelligence-Was-Enlightened-1038x583.jpg"}},{"file":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/articles/2016-08-14, On Enlightening the Mind/2016-08-14_On-Enlightening-the-Mind.md","title":"On Enlightening the Mind","author":"Moses Mendelssohn","pubdate":"2016-08-13","language":"en","likes":33,"tags":"enlightenment,civilization","img":"What-if-Artificial-Intelligence-Was-Enlightened-1038x583.jpg","category":"enlightenment","snip":"THE terms intellectual improvement, or enlightening the mind, cultivation, and civilization [Aufklärung, Kultur, Bildung], are as yet scarcely naturalized in the German language.","html":"\n<h3>Civilization, cultivation, and intellect</h3>\n<p>THE terms intellectual improvement, or enlightening the mind, cultivation, and civilization [Aufklärung, Kultur, Bildung], are as yet scarcely naturalized in the German language.

It is said of a certain nation, that they have no words for virtue and superstition, and yet no small portion of each may justly be ascribed to them.</p>\n<p>Common usage, however, although it apparently tends to establish a distinction between these nearly synonymous words, has not yet had time to fix the boundaries of each.</p>\n<p>Civilization, cultivation, and intellect, are modifications of social life, the result of the industry and exertions of mankind to improve the general happiness.</p>\n<p>The more the state of society of any nation is made to harmonize through art and industry with the respective conditions of men, to so much greater degree of civilization has that nation attained.</p>\n<p>Civilization may be divided into cultivation and enlightening the public mind, the former of which seems to be chiefly practical, and to consist of refinement, beauty, and perfection in mechanics, in the arts, and in the manners of society of talents and industry in the arts, and of moral inclinations and propensities. The more these agree with the condition of men, the more cultivation may they be said to have acquired, as a piece of land is said to be better cultivated, the more industry has been bestowed on it, so as to produce things useful to mankind; but on the other hand, enlightening seems to relate principally to theory or rational knowledge, and a facility to reason on the affairs of life according to their importance and influence on the condition of men.</p>\n<p>I consider the condition of man as the grand measure and end of all our exertions and labours, and as a point which we must constantly keep in view, if we would avoid losing ourselves in conjecture and speculation.</p>\n<p>A language becomes enlightened by means of the sciences, and it becomes cultivated or polished by means of social converse, poetry, and eloquence. By the former it becomes more adapted to objects of theory, and by the latter to those of practice. Both together give a language that quality which is denominated civilization.</p>\n<p>The highest degree of cultivation is called refinement. Happy is the nation whose refinement is the effect of cultivation, and of an enlightened state of the public mind, whose external lustre and polish arises from an internal solid basis of truth and virtue.</p>\n<p>An enlightened state of mind is to cultivation what theory generally is to practice, knowledge to morality, and criticism to taste. Considered in themselves, they stand in the nearest relation to each other, although they very often appear totally distinct.</p>\n<p>It may be said that the inhabitants of Nuremberg and of France are more cultivated, those of Berlin and of England more enlightened, while the Chinese are highly cultivated, but very unenlightened: the Greeks possessed both these qualities. They were a highly civilized and polished nation, as their language is a highly civilized and polished language. In general the language of a nation is the best measure and criterion of their civilization, as well as of the more or less enlightened state of the national mind, and of the expansion of that mind as well as of its strength.</p>\n<p>Farther, the actual condition of men may be divided into, 1. the condition of men considered as men, and, 2. the condition of men considered as citizens.</p>\n<p>In considering the subject of cultivation these objects coincide, as the value of all practical perfections depends alone on their influence on social life, and must accord with the actual condition of men as members of society. Men as men require no cultivation, but even in this point of view they require much enlightening.</p>\n<p>From the rank and profession of men in civil life arise certain duties and rights, and therefore in proportion to these require various talents and abilities, habits and inclinations, manners and customs, and degrees of cultivation and refinement; and the more these accord with the various ranks and professions of men, that is with their respective conditions as members of society, the more cultivation that nation may be said to have attained.</p>\n<p>To each individual, different theoretical knowledge, different abilities to acquire that knowledge, and different degrees of enlightened instruction, are necessary according to their various ranks and professions; but that species of improvement which regards men as men, is generally independent of the distinction of ranks, while that which regards men as citizens, is modified according to their ranks and professions in life. The condition of men, therefore, is here the measure and the end of their exertions.</p>\n<p>According to these rules the enlightening the public mind of any nation will he regulated, 1st, by the degree of knowledge they possess; 2d, by the importance of that knowledge, that is, relatively to the actual state and condition of men as men and as citizens; 3d, by its extension through the various ranks and classes of society; 4th, by the nature of their professions and vocations: and were the degree of this enlightening of a nation to be measured by a fourfold compound ratio, the component parts thereof separately taken, would be found to be themselves composed of other more simple ratios.</p>\n<p>The enlightening of the man may not always accord with that of the citizen. Many truths there are, which, however useful to men as men, may sometimes prove injurious to them as citizens. Here we must weigh the consequences. A collision may also arise between the essential or the accidental condition of the man, and the essential or accidental condition of the citizen. Were men deprived of their essential condition as men they would sink into brutes; deprived of their accidental condition, they would not be the elevated beings they now appear. Without their essential condition as citizens, the political constitution of society would cease to exist; without their accidental condition, society would no longer retain its due subordination.</p>\n<p>Unhappy is that country where the essential condition of the man does not harmonize with the essential condition of the citizen; where the degree of information which is indispensably necessary to men, cannot be extended through every class without danger to the political constitution.</p>\n<p>But when the accidental condition of the man comes in competition with the essential or accidental condition of the citizen, rules must be established, according to which exceptions may be made, and competitions may be decided.</p>\n<h3>Essential Condition of Men</h3>\n<p>When the essential condition of men is unfortunately brought into a state of opposition with their accidental condition, when men dare not explain certain useful and [42] ornamental truths to mankind at large, without undermining the foundations of religion and morality, the instructor of his fellow-citizens who has a due regard to virtue, will act with caution and prudence, and rather permit prejudice to continue, than banish truths with which it is so intimately united. This maxim, however, has certainly proved the strongest bulwark of priestcraft, and we are indebted to it for many centuries of barbarism and superstition. As often as men were willing to destroy this evil, it took refuge in the sanctuary; and yet the friends of mankind will, even in the most enlightened periods, obey this maxim.</p>\n<p>The more excellent any thing may be when perfect, says a Hebrew writer, the more prejudicial is it when corrupted and depraved. A rotten piece of wood is not so unpleasant as a corrupted flower; nor is this so disgusting as the putrid body of an animal; and this again is less horrible than a human corpse in a state of corruption. Thus it is with cultivation, and the enlightening the mind. The more valuable they may be at their first breaking forth, the more are they to be dreaded when in a state of corruption and destruction.</p>\n<p>The abuse of this enlightened state of mind weakens the-moral sense, leads to insensibility, egotism, irreligion, and anarchy. The abuse of cultivation gives birth to licentiousness, hypocrisy, effeminacy, superstition, and slavery.</p>\n<p>Where the enlightening and cultivation of mankind advance with equal pace, they become to each other the best security against corruption, and that civilization of any nation, which, according to the above definitions, consists of cultivation and an enlightened state of the public mind, is therefore the least liable to corruption.</p>\n<p>A civilized nation has no other internal danger to fear than the excess of its national happiness, which, like the most perfect health of the human body, may be called either in itself a disease, or at least a passage to it. A nation which has through civilization attained the highest pinnacle of national happiness, is for that very reason in danger of falling; whereas it cannot rise higher: but this would lead us too far from the question before us.</p>\n","parentDir":"2016-08-14, On Enlightening the Mind","baseid":"c50eb13c0b","id":"1d2f3b9192","slug":"2016-08-13_on-enlightening-the-mind","previnfo":{"id":"3fd17b3349","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"An Indian Folk Religion","slug":"2016-08-13_an-indian-folk-religion","language":"en","author":"Rabindranath Tagore","img":"46122bc4dca93e61413c2e750ca0974b.jpg"},"nextinfo":{"id":"a4d7127f1a","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Be Like Adam’s Son","slug":"2016-08-01_be-like-adams-son","language":"en","author":"Jawdat Sa’eed","img":"adam-and-eve-with-the-infants-cain-and-abel-lorenzo-de-ferrari.jpg"}},{"file":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/articles/2016-08-14, On Enlightening the Mind/2016-08-14_On-Enlightening-the-Mind_it.md","title":"On Enlightening the Mind IT","author":"Moses Mendelssohn","pubdate":"2016-08-13","language":"it","likes":33,"tags":"sit amet,consectetur","img":"What-if-Artificial-Intelligence-Was-Enlightened-1038x583.jpg","category":"enlightening","snip":"I termini miglioramento intellettuale, o illuminazione della mente, coltivazione e civiltà [Aufklärung, Kultur, Bildung], sono ancora scarsamente naturalizzati in lingua tedesca.","html":"\n<p>I termini miglioramento intellettuale, o illuminazione della mente, coltivazione e civiltà [Aufklärung, Kultur, Bildung], sono ancora scarsamente naturalizzati in lingua tedesca. Il loro uso è quasi limitato ai libri. Per la maggior parte dell'umanità sono poco conosciuti o capiti: ma può essere considerata una prova che gli oggetti che queste parole rappresentano sono nuovi o estranei a noi? Certamente no. Si dice di una certa nazione, che non hanno parole per la virtù e la superstizione, e tuttavia nessuna piccola parte di ciascuno può giustamente essere attribuita a loro.</p>\n<p>L'uso comune, tuttavia, anche se apparentemente tende a stabilire una distinzione tra queste parole quasi sinonimi, non ha ancora avuto il tempo di fissare i confini di ciascuna.</p>\n<p>La civiltà, la coltivazione e l'intelletto sono modifiche della vita sociale, il risultato dell'industria e gli sforzi dell'umanità per migliorare la felicità generale.</p>\n<p>Quanto più lo stato della società di qualsiasi nazione è fatto per armonizzarsi attraverso l'arte e l'industria con le rispettive condizioni degli uomini, tanto più alto è il livello di civiltà raggiunto dalla nazione.</p>\n<p>La civiltà può essere divisa in coltivazione e illuminante nella mente pubblica, la prima delle quali sembra essere principalmente pratica, e consiste di raffinatezza, bellezza e perfezione nella meccanica, nelle arti e nei modi della società dei talenti e dell'industria in le arti, e le inclinazioni e le inclinazioni morali. Più questi sono d'accordo con la condizione degli uomini, più si può dire che la coltivazione abbia acquisito, come si dice che un pezzo di terra è coltivato meglio, più l'industria è stata donata su di essa, in modo da produrre cose utili all'umanità ; ma d'altra parte, l'illuminazione sembra riguardare principalmente la teoria o la conoscenza razionale, e una facilità di ragionare sugli affari della vita in base alla loro importanza e influenza sulla condizione degli uomini.</p>\n<p>Considero la condizione dell'uomo come la grande misura e la fine di tutti i nostri sforzi e fatiche, e come un punto che dobbiamo costantemente tenere in considerazione, se evitassimo di perdersi in congetture e speculazioni.</p>\n<p>Una lingua diventa illuminata per mezzo delle scienze e diventa coltivata o levigata per mezzo di conversazioni sociali, poesia ed eloquenza.

Erano una nazione altamente civilizzata e raffinata, poiché la loro lingua è un linguaggio altamente civilizzato e raffinato.

In that parable, we have two distinct methods of dealing with life's problems, since one of Adam's sons tried to get over the problem by killing the other, like a doctor trying to get over the disease by killing the patient; and the other held back his hand, and affirmed that killing could not be the right solution.</p>\n<p>I may mention here that it is fortunate that I propound my idea at this juncture in time, when mankind happens to be primed for comprehending the method of Adam's son. Humankind has almost understood, through lots and lots of suicidal trials, that violence is just not the way. For my part, I have devoted all my humble effort to bringing this fact to the notice of humankind. I have no doubt that later studies will greatly overshadow my effort. My only accomplishment would be then that I have shaken the sleepers to open their eyes and see things from a vantage point that they had never suspected to exist.</p>\n<p>So let us start with this point. One big hurdle that prevents Arabs and Muslims from probing their dilemmas is Israel. But they seem to forget in this respect that our real problem is not Israel, nor the imperial powers. A more basic problem that lurks behind our tragic conditions is that we suffer from certain mental drawbacks for which neither Israel, nor any imperial power, are responsible. Long ago the Qur'an warned us to look for our troubles in the right place: &quot; Say: 'It is from yourselves.'&quot; (3:165) If any still have doubts that our basic ills lie within our souls, let them remember the Second Gulf War, when we forgot about Israel, and were sure that more important than Israel were the disputes among us – we even summoned those same imperial powers to help us defeat our domestic 'enemy.'</p>\n<p>Just make peace among yourselves, with each other, and you will see, Arabs and Muslims, how the world will respect you, will try to win your favor; and you will see how America will turn its back on Israel; because America has always changed sides when it proved more profitable to do so.</p>\n<p>The point here is that no one can subjugate us unless we agree to be subjugated. But if we still refuse to learn, then more catastrophes and more scourge will force us one day to learn, though after we have paid for our failure to open our ears and eyes earlier. We shall have to learn, if not through learning from history, then from more pain and catastrophes. The Qur'an is replete with exhortation to look and listen and think, as in this verse, &quot;And how many signs in the heavens and earth do they pass by? Yet they turn their faces away from them.&quot; (12:105)</p>\n<p>Can we for instance envision a future situation in which we have really established peace among ourselves, peace whereby no one will have to jeopardize anything, neither territory, nor position? Can our intellectuals perceive that? It will be clear then that what we need is not the great hero that comes forth and forces us by might into a unified body. For as long as we keep waiting for the one man to come and draw us out of the abyss we shall never find our way.</p>\n<p>But I am sure that the light of day is coming, because of what God has promised, &quot;Their intention is to extinguish Allah's Light by blowing with their mouths; but Allah will complete the revelation of His Light,&quot; (61:8) and on the basis of what I have seen and heard in this world.</p>\n<p class=\"sig\">Beer Ajam (a village southwest of Syria), 6/11/1996</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>INTRODUCTORY, THE LANGUAGE OF WORDS AND THE LANGUAGE OF CONCEPTS</h2>\n<p>Let us start our discussion with the following short tradition of the Prophet's (peace be upon him): &quot;Follow the example of Adam's son&quot; (an authentic tradition, reported by al-Tirmidhi, and also, in slightly different wording, by Abu Dawood.)</p>\n<p>Is not this a tradition of the Prophet's? If so, why have Muslims generally not cared for it? Or even flouted and derided the concept in it? I still remember when, as I was once elaborating on this, one among the audience said: &quot;Nay! I will never buy this! If I am to enter Paradise, I want to enter it with my sword brandished high in my hands; never with my head bent down with submission and surrender.&quot;</p>\n<p>Often have we seen a Muslim scholar devote a whole book to the explication of one tradition of the Prophet's (peace be upon him), so why have all the scholars totally ignored the above tradition?</p>\n<p>To go one further step; let us inquire what renders a certain text idle and inoperative? It is worth our while to inquire how the Qur'an and the sunnah (the Prophet's traditions) have fared across the ages, how certain portions are ignored and others attended to. A whole science should be dedicated to the study of the processes through which texts come to be brought into life or thrown into oblivion. I know some light has been thrown on this, but it is not yet developed into a science, which we do need.</p>\n<p>We do notice how humans' minds go through changes, as a result of which they are most inattentive to things that used to be of primary importance; and how often this happens to us, and in connection with our most precious texts! That is why I yearn to see people investigate why for instance we ignore certain parts of the Qur'an and the Prophet's traditions. (I did raise such inquiry in my Foreword to the book No, Jury, God Before King!)</p>\n<p>The Messenger was once mentioning a certain future event, when he commented: &quot;This will take place when men have deserted knowledge.&quot; One companion, Ziad bin Labid, objected: &quot;How can this be, Messenger of Allah, when we learn the Qur'an and will have our children recite it, and they will have their children recite it, and so on until the Day of Judgment?&quot; &quot;Oh, Ziad! I used to take you to think better than most in Medina! Do you not see how the Jews and the Christians still hold the Bible, yet it does them no good at all?&quot; (A fairly authentic tradition, reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah.)</p>\n<p>We may say in light of the above tradition that we have the language of letters and words, and the language of concepts and ideas. In the above parable of Adam's two sons, the aggressor could not grasp certain notions – his concepts were not mature enough to handle the situation as a human being should do. And when the Prophet spoke to the Quraish tribe in Makkah (Mecca) they failed to comprehend, though he used the same medium they used – they all shared the same Arabic language; but the dispute was over a certain rigid worldview of theirs which they refused to reconsider.</p>\n<p>I do realize that the modern age is beginning to see more into such matters. The problems connected with this have been with humankind since humans walked on this planet, but analyzing them is quite recent. The average Muslim is happy that he/she was born in a certain culture, for he/she says: &quot;Thank God I was born in a Muslim culture; for if I were born elsewhere, I would be a follower of a different religion.&quot; He is virtually saying here: &quot;If I had been born in a different part of the world, I would have followed that culture's religion, would have taken over their worldview, their ideas about salvation, about sacred texts, and about whence we came and where we go. I would have taken other men for models of perfection, and as my reference for right conduct.&quot;</p>\n<p>How hard it is to make a fresh start and to change direction can be ascertained from exploring precedents in history. But we may begin to open our eyes by reflecting on how the Muslim has come to a state when many texts, those of the Qur'an and sunnah (the Prophet's traditions), fall on deaf ears.</p>\n<p>Muslims are especially wary of social sciences – they are worried that such sciences would unearth facts about humankind which contravene the Qur'an or the sunnah, for Muslims would not say then that what proved to be false was their own comprehension of the Qur’an and sunnah, but the Qur'an and sunnah themselves. It is hard for them to admit that their minds can have borne illusions that blur comprehension. The cocoon in which they hide all that they take to be sacred is believed to be inherent in texts; and that is why men have often preferred to die in defense of concepts which they sanctify, for they take them to come from God. If the Prophet's companion failed in the above tradition to comprehend how knowledge may deplete, then how can we be sure that we have not fallen into the same pit in which the Jews and Christians fell? And by the way we are again wrong when we do not delve into the Bible and see in it the light that the Qur'an has asserted it has: &quot; It was We Who revealed the Law to Moses: therein was guidance and light. … therefore fear not men, but fear Me, and do not sell My Signs for a miserable price.&quot; (5:44) Instead, we quite simply say: &quot;They have gone astray because their Scriptures have been distorted while we will never go astray as our Scripture will never be distorted, for it has been preserved by God Himself.”</p>\n<p>One thing one may conclude is that texts may often not help in leading people out of their dilemmas; we may be in need of another paradigm that helps us benefit from the light of the Qur’an; we really need to reflect on that which the Messenger was concerned about, and foresaw that the Muslims would encounter in the same way as other nations had encountered.</p>\n<h3>Adam’s son and the Quibbling Factions</h3>\n<p>Over the ages we have seen how the Muslim factions, like the followers of other religions, have clashed with each other and killed each other in the name of their understanding of religion. But we have a good model in Adam’s son – for he announced his refusal to be a party in this vicious circle of killing and counter-killing. And when the Messenger, peace be upon him, told two of his companions, on two separate occasions, to keep aloof when people went into partisan fighting, was he demanding something that clashed with normal human nature?</p>\n<p>It is still a far cry to urge a Muslim adopt the way of Adam’s son, for men still say that such stance goes contrary to humankind's instinct and inborn nature. And I fully realize that to overcome this concept it is not enough to cite verses of the Qur’an or traditions of the Prophet. But I do urge the Muslim to think of the following fact about the Qur’an: God does not mention the ruling concerning inheritance more than once or twice, but He mentions the facts of history scores of times. How often the Qur'an represents scenes from the lives of previous nations and peoples, what brought perdition to nations, what was the outcome of people's turning a blind ear to the facts of history, or denying that they could find in history any useful lessons!</p>\n<p>It will be a definite step forward when we take the events of history as our concrete evidence that the Qur'an is a book of truth. On the other hand we shall never be able to go forward as long as we take an arrogant stance towards history, and believe that we are somehow above its rules. When a people believe that they are exempted from the verdicts of history they will no longer give heed to its lessons.

In quella parabola, abbiamo due metodi distinti per affrontare i problemi della vita, poiché uno dei figli di Adamo ha cercato di superare il problema uccidendo l'altro, come un medico che cerca di superare la malattia uccidendo il paziente; e l'altro trattenne la mano e affermò che uccidere non poteva essere la soluzione giusta.</p>\n<p>Potrei menzionare qui che è una fortuna che io proponga la mia idea in questo frangente nel tempo, quando l'umanità sembra essere pronta per comprendere il metodo del figlio di Adamo. L'umanità ha quasi capito, attraverso un sacco di prove suicide, che la violenza non è la via giusta. Da parte mia, ho dedicato tutto il mio umile sforzo per portare questo fatto all'attenzione dell'umanità. Non ho dubbi sul fatto che studi successivi offuscheranno enormemente i miei sforzi. Il mio unico risultato sarebbe allora che ho scosso i dormienti per aprire gli occhi e vedere le cose da un punto di vista che non avevano mai sospettato di esistere.</p>\n<p>Quindi iniziamo con questo punto. Un grande ostacolo che impedisce agli arabi e ai musulmani di sondare i loro dilemmi è Israele. Ma sembrano dimenticare a questo riguardo che il nostro vero problema non è Israele, né i poteri imperiali. Un problema più basilare che si nasconde dietro le nostre tragiche condizioni è che soffriamo di alcuni inconvenienti mentali per i quali né Israele né alcun potere imperiale sono responsabili. Molto tempo fa il Corano ci ha avvertito di cercare i nostri problemi nel posto giusto: &quot;Di ':&quot; È da voi stessi &quot;. (3: 165) Se qualcuno ha ancora dei dubbi sul fatto che i nostri mali di base si trovano nelle nostre anime, lasciateli ricorda la Seconda Guerra del Golfo, quando abbiamo dimenticato di Israele, ed eravamo sicuri che più importanti di Israele fossero le dispute tra di noi - abbiamo persino convocato quelle stesse potenze imperiali per aiutarci a sconfiggere il nostro nemico domestico.</p>\n<p>Basta fare pace tra di voi, l'uno con l'altro, e vedrete, arabi e musulmani, come il mondo vi rispetterà, proverà a conquistare il vostro favore; e vedrai come l'America volterà le spalle a Israele; perché l'America ha sempre cambiato le parti quando si è dimostrato più redditizio farlo.</p>\n<p>Il punto qui è che nessuno può sottometterci se non accettiamo di essere soggiogati. Ma se ci rifiutiamo ancora di imparare, più catastrofi e più flagelli ci costringeranno un giorno a imparare, anche se dopo aver pagato per il nostro fallimento di aprire le orecchie e gli occhi prima. Dovremo imparare, se non attraverso l'apprendimento dalla storia, poi da più dolore e catastrofi. Il Corano è pieno di esortazioni per guardare, ascoltare e pensare, come in questo verso, &quot;E quanti segni nei cieli e nella terra passano?&quot; Eppure allontanano il loro volto da loro &quot;. (12: 105)</p>\n<p>Possiamo per esempio immaginare una situazione futura in cui abbiamo veramente stabilito la pace tra di noi, pace in cui nessuno dovrà mettere a repentaglio nulla, né territorio, né posizione? I nostri intellettuali possono percepirlo? Sarà chiaro allora che ciò di cui abbiamo bisogno non è il grande eroe che viene fuori e ci costringe per forza a un corpo unificato. Finché continueremo ad aspettare che un solo uomo venga e ci trascinerà fuori dall'abisso non troveremo mai la nostra strada.</p>\n<p>Ma sono sicuro che la luce del giorno sta arrivando, a causa di ciò che Dio ha promesso: &quot;La loro intenzione è di estinguere la luce di Allah soffiando con le loro bocche, ma Allah completerà la rivelazione della sua luce&quot; (61: 8) e sulla base di ciò che ho visto e sentito in questo mondo.</p>\n<p class=\"sig\">Beer Ajam (un villaggio a sud-ovest della Siria), 6/11/1996</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>INTRODUTTORE, LINGUA DELLE PAROLE E LINGUA DEI CONCETTI</h2>\n<p>Cominciamo la nostra discussione con la seguente breve tradizione del Profeta (pace su di lui): &quot;Segui l'esempio del figlio di Adamo&quot; (una tradizione autentica, riportata da al-Tirmidhi, e anche, in termini leggermente diversi, da Abu Dawood .)</p>\n<p>Non è questa una tradizione del Profeta? Se è così, perché i musulmani in genere non se ne prendono cura? O ha persino vaneggiato e deriso il concetto in esso? Ricordo ancora quando, come una volta mi stavo elaborando, uno tra il pubblico disse: &quot;No, non lo comprerò mai! Se devo entrare in Paradiso, voglio entrare con la mia spada brandita in alto nelle mie mani, mai con la mia testa china per sottomissione e arrendersi. &quot;</p>\n<p>Spesso abbiamo visto uno studioso musulmano dedicare un intero libro alla spiegazione di una tradizione del Profeta (la pace sia con lui), quindi perché tutti gli studiosi hanno completamente ignorato la tradizione di cui sopra?</p>\n<p>To go one further step; let us inquire what renders a certain text idle and inoperative? It is worth our while to inquire how the Qur'an and the sunnah (the Prophet's traditions) have fared across the ages, how certain portions are ignored and others attended to. A whole science should be dedicated to the study of the processes through which texts come to be brought into life or thrown into oblivion. I know some light has been thrown on this, but it is not yet developed into a science, which we do need.</p>\n<p>We do notice how humans' minds go through changes, as a result of which they are most inattentive to things that used to be of primary importance; and how often this happens to us, and in connection with our most precious texts! That is why I yearn to see people investigate why for instance we ignore certain parts of the Qur'an and the Prophet's traditions. (I did raise such inquiry in my Foreword to the book No, Jury, God Before King!)</p>\n<p>The Messenger was once mentioning a certain future event, when he commented: &quot;This will take place when men have deserted knowledge.&quot; One companion, Ziad bin Labid, objected: &quot;How can this be, Messenger of Allah, when we learn the Qur'an and will have our children recite it, and they will have their children recite it, and so on until the Day of Judgment?&quot; &quot;Oh, Ziad! I used to take you to think better than most in Medina! Do you not see how the Jews and the Christians still hold the Bible, yet it does them no good at all?&quot; (A fairly authentic tradition, reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah.)</p>\n<p>We may say in light of the above tradition that we have the language of letters and words, and the language of concepts and ideas. In the above parable of Adam's two sons, the aggressor could not grasp certain notions – his concepts were not mature enough to handle the situation as a human being should do. And when the Prophet spoke to the Quraish tribe in Makkah (Mecca) they failed to comprehend, though he used the same medium they used – they all shared the same Arabic language; but the dispute was over a certain rigid worldview of theirs which they refused to reconsider.</p>\n<p>I do realize that the modern age is beginning to see more into such matters. The problems connected with this have been with humankind since humans walked on this planet, but analyzing them is quite recent. The average Muslim is happy that he/she was born in a certain culture, for he/she says: &quot;Thank God I was born in a Muslim culture; for if I were born elsewhere, I would be a follower of a different religion.&quot; He is virtually saying here: &quot;If I had been born in a different part of the world, I would have followed that culture's religion, would have taken over their worldview, their ideas about salvation, about sacred texts, and about whence we came and where we go. I would have taken other men for models of perfection, and as my reference for right conduct.&quot;</p>\n<p>How hard it is to make a fresh start and to change direction can be ascertained from exploring precedents in history. But we may begin to open our eyes by reflecting on how the Muslim has come to a state when many texts, those of the Qur'an and sunnah (the Prophet's traditions), fall on deaf ears.</p>\n<p>Muslims are especially wary of social sciences – they are worried that such sciences would unearth facts about humankind which contravene the Qur'an or the sunnah, for Muslims would not say then that what proved to be false was their own comprehension of the Qur’an and sunnah, but the Qur'an and sunnah themselves. It is hard for them to admit that their minds can have borne illusions that blur comprehension. The cocoon in which they hide all that they take to be sacred is believed to be inherent in texts; and that is why men have often preferred to die in defense of concepts which they sanctify, for they take them to come from God. If the Prophet's companion failed in the above tradition to comprehend how knowledge may deplete, then how can we be sure that we have not fallen into the same pit in which the Jews and Christians fell? And by the way we are again wrong when we do not delve into the Bible and see in it the light that the Qur'an has asserted it has: &quot; It was We Who revealed the Law to Moses: therein was guidance and light. … therefore fear not men, but fear Me, and do not sell My Signs for a miserable price.&quot; (5:44) Instead, we quite simply say: &quot;They have gone astray because their Scriptures have been distorted while we will never go astray as our Scripture will never be distorted, for it has been preserved by God Himself.”</p>\n<p>One thing one may conclude is that texts may often not help in leading people out of their dilemmas; we may be in need of another paradigm that helps us benefit from the light of the Qur’an; we really need to reflect on that which the Messenger was concerned about, and foresaw that the Muslims would encounter in the same way as other nations had encountered.</p>\n<h3>Adam’s son and the Quibbling Factions</h3>\n<p>Over the ages we have seen how the Muslim factions, like the followers of other religions, have clashed with each other and killed each other in the name of their understanding of religion. But we have a good model in Adam’s son – for he announced his refusal to be a party in this vicious circle of killing and counter-killing. And when the Messenger, peace be upon him, told two of his companions, on two separate occasions, to keep aloof when people went into partisan fighting, was he demanding something that clashed with normal human nature?</p>\n<p>It is still a far cry to urge a Muslim adopt the way of Adam’s son, for men still say that such stance goes contrary to humankind's instinct and inborn nature. And I fully realize that to overcome this concept it is not enough to cite verses of the Qur’an or traditions of the Prophet. But I do urge the Muslim to think of the following fact about the Qur’an: God does not mention the ruling concerning inheritance more than once or twice, but He mentions the facts of history scores of times. How often the Qur'an represents scenes from the lives of previous nations and peoples, what brought perdition to nations, what was the outcome of people's turning a blind ear to the facts of history, or denying that they could find in history any useful lessons!</p>\n<p>It will be a definite step forward when we take the events of history as our concrete evidence that the Qur'an is a book of truth. On the other hand we shall never be able to go forward as long as we take an arrogant stance towards history, and believe that we are somehow above its rules. When a people believe that they are exempted from the verdicts of history they will no longer give heed to its lessons. It was Satan who first boasted that what applied to others did not apply to him. Once you take your race, your nation, your tribe, or your creed not to be subject to the same laws as apply to others, that you have some special relationship with God or that you are of His own family, regardless of how you behave, then you will have chosen Satan's way.</p>\n<p>This disease of arrogance and pride is something that makes one condemned to exclusion from entering Paradise, for the Prophet, peace be upon him, says, “No human will enter Paradise in whose heart there is the least grain of pride.” (Related by Muslim) It is for this flaw of haughtiness that Satan was ejected from heaven, as the Qur'an reports, (15:34-35).</p>\n<p>On the other hand Adam’s son chose not to rise above the others; by holding his hand from assaulting the other, he announced his rejection of any kind of arrogance.</p>\n","parentDir":"2016-08-02, Be Like Adam's Son","baseid":"8fff89fba4","id":"96a532a400","slug":"2016-08-01_be-like-adams-son-it_it","base":{"id":"a4d7127f1a","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Be Like Adam’s Son","slug":"2016-08-01_be-like-adams-son","language":"en","author":"Jawdat Sa’eed","img":"adam-and-eve-with-the-infants-cain-and-abel-lorenzo-de-ferrari.jpg"},"tagmatches":[{"id":"d299f53dce","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Developing a Good Heart IT","slug":"2018-11-17_developing-a-good-heart-it_it","language":"it","author":"Dalai Lama","img":"Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg"},{"id":"9a1dfc5410","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Thomas Merton Memoirs about Interfaith IT","slug":"2016-10-26_thomas-merton-memoirs-about-interfaith-it_it","language":"it","author":"Thomas Merton","img":"Dhirendra-Brahmachari.jpeg"},{"id":"aef757839a","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"On Enlightening the Mind IT","slug":"2016-08-13_on-enlightening-the-mind-it_it","language":"it","author":"Moses Mendelssohn","img":"What-if-Artificial-Intelligence-Was-Enlightened-1038x583.jpg"},{"id":"47a9a7c740","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Essay on the Trinity IT","slug":"2016-03-10_essay-on-the-trinity-it_it","language":"it","author":"Jonathan Edwards","img":"2000px-Society_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Most_Holy_Trinity_badge.svg.png"}],"previnfo":{"id":"aef757839a","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"On Enlightening the Mind IT","slug":"2016-08-13_on-enlightening-the-mind-it_it","language":"it","author":"Moses Mendelssohn","img":"What-if-Artificial-Intelligence-Was-Enlightened-1038x583.jpg"},"nextinfo":{"id":"47a9a7c740","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Essay on the Trinity IT","slug":"2016-03-10_essay-on-the-trinity-it_it","language":"it","author":"Jonathan Edwards","img":"2000px-Society_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Most_Holy_Trinity_badge.svg.png"}},{"file":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/articles/2016-03-11, Essay on the Trinity/2016-03-11_Essay-on-the-Trinity.md","title":"Essay on the Trinity","author":"Jonathan Edwards","pubdate":"2016-03-10","language":"en","likes":74,"tags":"sit amet,consectetur","img":"2000px-Society_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Most_Holy_Trinity_badge.svg.png","category":"trinity","snip":"IT IS COMMON when speaking of the Divine happiness to say that God is infinitely happy in the enjoyment of Himself, in perfectly beholding and infinitely loving, and rejoicing in, His own essence and perfection.","html":"\n<h2>Essay on the Trinity</h2>\n<p>IT IS COMMON when speaking of the Divine happiness to say that God is infinitely happy in the enjoyment of Himself, in perfectly beholding and infinitely loving, and rejoicing in, His own essence and perfection, and accordingly it must be supposed that God perpetually and eternally has a most perfect idea of Himself, as it were an exact image and representation of Himself ever before Him and in actual view, and from hence arises a most pure and perfect act or energy in the Godhead, which is the Divine love, complacence and joy. The knowledge or view which God has of Himself must necessarily be conceived to be something distinct from His mere direct existence. There must be something that answers to our reflection. The reflection as we reflect on our own minds carries something of imperfection in it. However, if God beholds Himself so as thence to have delight and joy in Himself He must become his own object. There must be a duplicity. There is God and the idea of God, if it be proper to call a conception of that that is purely spiritual an idea.</p>\n<p>If a man could have an absolutely perfect idea of all that passed in his mind, all the series of ideas and exercises in every respect perfect as to order, degree, circumstance and for any particular space of time past, suppose the last hour, he would really to all intents and purpose be over again what he was that last hour. And if it were possible for a man by reflection perfectly to contemplate all that is in his own mind in an hour, as it is and at the same time that it is there in its first and direct existence; if a man, that is, had a perfect reflex or contemplative idea of every thought at the same moment or moments that that thought was and of every exercise at and during the same time that that exercise was, and so through a whole hour, a man would really be two during that time, he would be indeed double, he would be twice at once. The idea he has of himself would be himself again.</p>\n<p>Note, by having a reflex or contemplative idea of what passes in our own minds I don't mean consciousness only. There is a great difference between a man's having a view of himself, reflex or contemplative idea of himself so as to delight in his own beauty or excellency, and a mere direct consciousness. Or if we mean by consciousness of what is in our own minds anything besides the mere simple existence in our minds of what is there, it is nothing but a power by reflection to view or contemplate what passes.</p>\n<p>Therefore as God with perfect clearness, fullness and strength, understands Himself, views His own essence (in which there is no distinction of substance and act but which is wholly substance and wholly act), that idea which God hath of Himself is absolutely Himself. This representation of the Divine nature and essence is the Divine nature and essence again: so that by God's thinking of the Deity must certainly be generated. Hereby there is another person begotten, there is another Infinite Eternal Almighty and most holy and the same God, the very same Divine nature.</p>\n<p>And this Person is the second person in the Trinity, the Only Begotten and dearly Beloved Son of God; He is the eternal, necessary, perfect, substantial and personal idea which God hath of Himself; and that it is so seems to me to be abundantly confirmed by the Word of God.</p>\n<h3>The form of God</h3>\n<p>Nothing can more agree with the account the Scripture gives us of the Son of God, His being in the form of God and His express and perfect image and representation: (II Cor. 4:4) &quot;Lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ Who is the image of God should shine unto them.&quot; (Phil. 2:6) &quot;Who being in the form of God.&quot; (Col. 1:15) &quot;Who is the image of the invisible God.&quot; (Heb. 1:3) &quot;Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person.&quot;</p>\n<p>Christ is called the face of God (Exod. 33:14): the word [A.V. presence] in the original signifies face, looks, form or appearance. Now what can be so properly and fitly called so with respect to God as God's own perfect idea of Himself whereby He has every moment a view of His own essence: this idea is that &quot;face of God&quot; which God sees as a man sees his own face in a looking glass. 'Tis of such form or appearance whereby God eternally appears to Himself. The root that the original word comes from signifies to look upon or behold: now what is that which God looks upon or beholds in so eminent a manner as He doth on His own idea or that perfect image of Himself which He has in view. This is what is eminently in God's presence and is therefore called the angel of God's presence or face (Isa. 63:9). But that the Son of God is God's own eternal and perfect idea is a thing we have yet much more expressly revealed in God's Word. First, in that Christ is called &quot;the wisdom of God.&quot; If we are taught in the Scripture that Christ is the same with God's wisdom or knowledge, then it teaches us that He is the same with God's perfect and eternal idea. They are the same as we have already observed and I suppose none will deny. But Christ is said to be the wisdom of God (I Cor. 1:24, Luke 11:49, compare with Matt. 23:34); and how much doth Christ speak in Proverbs under the name of Wisdom especially in the 8th chapter.</p>\n<p>The Godhead being thus begotten by God's loving an idea of Himself and shewing forth in a distinct subsistence or person in that idea, there proceeds a most pure act, and an infinitely holy and sacred energy arises between the Father and Son in mutually loving and delighting in each other, for their love and joy is mutual, (Prov. 8:30) &quot;I was daily His delight rejoicing always before Him.&quot; This is the eternal and most perfect and essential act of the Divine nature, wherein the Godhead acts to an infinite degree and in the most perfect manner possible. The Deity becomes all act, the Divine essence itself flows out and is as it were breathed forth in love and joy. So that the Godhead therein stands forth in yet another manner of subsistence, and there proceeds the third Person in the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, viz., the Deity in act, for there is no other act but the act of the will.</p>\n<p>We may learn by the Word of God that the Godhead or the Divine nature and essence does subsist in love. (I John 4:8) &quot;He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.&quot; In the context of which place I think it is plainly intimated to us that the Holy Spirit is that Love, as in the 12th and 13th verses. &quot;If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His love is perfected in us; hereby know we that we dwell in Him ... because He hath given us of His Spirit.&quot; 'Tis the same argument in both verses. In the 12th verse the apostle argues that if we have love dwelling in us we have God dwelling in us, and in the 13th verse He clears the force of the argument by this that love is God's Spirit. Seeing we have God's Spirit dwelling in us, we have God dwelling in [in us], supposing it as a thing granted and allowed that God's Spirit is God. 'Tis evident also by this that God's dwelling in us and His love or the love that He hath exerciseth, being in us, are the same thing. The same is intimated in the same manner in the last verse of the foregoing chapter. The apostle was, in the foregoing verses, speaking of love as a sure sign of sincerity and our acceptance with God, beginning with the 18th verse, and he sums up the argument thus in the last verse, &quot;and hereby do we know that He abideth in us by the Spirit that He hath given us.&quot;</p>\n<p>The Scripture seems in many places to speak of love in Christians as if it were the same with the Spirit of God in them, or at least as the prime and most natural breathing and acting of the Spirit in the soul. (Phil. 2:1) &quot;If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, any comfort of love, any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels of mercies, fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.&quot; (II Cor. 6:6) &quot;By kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned.&quot; (Romans 15:30) &quot;Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit.&quot; (Col. 1:8) &quot;Who declared unto us your love in the Spirit.&quot; (Rom. 5:5) &quot;Having the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.&quot; (Gal. 5:13-16) &quot;Use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.&quot; The Apostle argues that Christian liberty does not make way for fulfilling the lusts of the flesh in biting and devouring one another and the like, because a principle of love which was the fulfilling of the law would prevent it, and in the 16th verse he asserts the same thing in other words: &quot;This I say then walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.&quot;</p>\n<p>The third and last office of the Holy Spirit is to comfort and delight the souls of God's people, and thus one of His names is the Comforter, and thus we have the phrase of &quot;joy in the Holy Ghost.&quot; (I Thess. 1:6) &quot;Having received the Word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost.&quot; (Rom. 14: 17) &quot;The kingdom of God is ... righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.&quot; (Acts 9:31) &quot;Walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.&quot; But how well doth this agree with the Holy Ghost being God's joy and delight, (Acts 13:52) &quot;And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost&quot;--meaning as I suppose that they were filled with spiritual joy.</p>\n<p>This is confirmed by the symbol of the Holy Ghost, viz., a dove, which is the emblem of love or a lover, and is so used in Scripture, and especially often so in Solomon's Song, (1:15) &quot;Behold thou art fair; my love, behold thou art fair; thou hast dove's eyes:&quot; i.e. &quot;Eyes of love,&quot; and again 4:1, the same words; and 5:12, &quot;His eyes are as the eyes of doves,&quot; and 5:2, &quot;My love, my dove,&quot; and 2:14 and 6:9; and this I believe to be the reason that the dove alone of all birds (except the sparrow in the single case of the leprosy) was appointed to be offered in sacrifice because of its innocence and because it is the emblem of love, love being the most acceptable sacrifice to God. It was under this similitude that the Holy Ghost descended from the Father on Christ at His baptism, signifying the infinite love of the Father to the Son, Who is the true David, or beloved, as we said before.</p>\n<p>The same was signified by what was exhibited to the eye in the appearance there was of the Holy Ghost descending from the Father to the Son in the shape of a dove, as was signified by what was exhibited to the eye in the voice there was at the same time, viz., &quot;This is My well Beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased.&quot;</p>\n<p>(That God's love or His loving kindness is the same with the Holy Ghost seems to be plain by Psalm 36:7-9, &quot;How excellent (or how precious as 'tis in the Hebrew) is Thy loving-kindness O God, therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Thy wings, they shall be abundantly satisfied (in the Hebrew &quot;watered&quot;) with the fatness of Thy house and Thou shalt make them to drink of the river of Thy pleasures; for with Thee is the fountain of life and in Thy light shall we see light.&quot;</p>\n<p>Doubtless that precious loving-kindness and that fatness of God's house and river of His pleasures and the water of the fountain of life and God's light here spoken [of] are the same thing; by which we learn that the Holy anointing oil that was kept in the House of God, which was a type of the Holy Ghost, represented God's love, and that the &quot;River of water of life&quot; spoken of in the 22nd [chapter] of Revelation, which proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, which is the same with Ezekiel's vision of Living and life-giving water, which is here [in Ps. 36] called the &quot;Fountain of life and river of God's pleasures,&quot; is God's loving-kindness.</p>\n<p>But Christ Himself expressly teaches us that by spiritual fountains and rivers of water of life is meant the Holy Ghost. (John 4:14; 7:38,39).That by the river of God's pleasures here is meant the same thing with the pure river of water of life spoken of in Revelation 22:1, will be much confirmed if we compare those verses with Revelation 21:23, 24; 22:1,5. (See the notes on chapters 21, 23, 24) I think if we compare these places and weigh them we cannot doubt but that it is the same happiness that is meant in this Psalm which is spoken of there.)</p>\n<p>So this well agrees with the similitudes and metaphors that are used about the Holy Ghost in Scripture, such as water, fire, breath, wind, oil, wine, a spring, a river, a being poured out and shed forth, and a being breathed forth. Can there any spiritual thing be thought, or anything belonging to any spiritual being to which such kind of metaphors so naturally agree, as to the affection of a Spirit. The affection, love or joy, may be said to flow out as water or to be breathed forth as breath or wind. But it would [not] sound so well to say that an idea or judgment flows out or is breathed forth.</p>\n<p>It is no way different to say of the affection that it is warm, or to compare love to fire, but it would not seem natural to say the same of perception or reason. It seems natural enough to say that the soul is poured out in affection or that love or delight are shed abroad: (Rom. 5:5) &quot;The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts,&quot; but it suits with nothing else belonging to a spiritual being.</p>\n<h2>This is that &quot;river of water of life&quot;</h2>\n<p>This is that &quot;river of water of life&quot; spoken of in the 22nd [chapter] of Revelation, which proceeds from the throne of the Father and the Son, for the rivers of living water or water of life are the Holy Ghost, by the same apostle's own interpretation (John 7:38, 39); and the Holy Ghost being the infinite delight and pleasure of God, the river is called the river of God's pleasures (Ps. 36:8), not God's river of pleasures, which I suppose signifies the same as the fatness of God's House, which they that trust in God shall be watered with, by which fatness of God's House I suppose is signified the same thing which oil typifies.</p>\n<p>It is a confirmation that the Holy Ghost is God's love and delight, because the saints communion with God consists in their partaking of the Holy Ghost. The communion of saints is twofold: 'tis their communion with God and communion with one another, (I John 1:3) &quot;That ye also may have fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.&quot; Communion is a common partaking of good, either of excellency or happiness, so that when it is said the saints have communion or fellowship with the Father and with the Son, the meaning of it is that they partake with the Father and the Son of their good, which is either their excellency and glory (II Peter 1:4), &quot;Ye are made partakers of the Divine nature&quot;; Heb. 12:10, &quot;That we might be partakers of His holiness;&quot; John 17:22, 23, &quot;And the glory which Thou hast given Me I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one, I in them and Thou in Me&quot;); or of their joy and happiness: (John 17:13) &quot;That they might have My joy fulfilled in themselves.&quot;\nBut the Holy Ghost being the love and joy of God is His beauty and happiness, and it is in our partaking of the same Holy Spirit that our communion with God consists: (II Cor. 13:14) &quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all, Amen.&quot; They are not different benefits but the same that the Apostle here wisheth, viz., the Holy Ghost: in partaking of the Holy Ghost, we possess and enjoy the love and grace of the Father and the Son, for the Holy Ghost is that love and grace, and therefore I suppose it is that in that forementioned place, (I John 1:3). We are said to have fellowship with the Son and not with the Holy Ghost, because therein consists our fellowship with the Father and the Son, even in partaking with them of the Holy Ghost.</p>\n<p>In this also eminently consists our communion with the Son that we drink into the same Spirit. This is the common excellency and joy and happiness in which they all are united; 'tis the bond of perfectness by which they are one in the Father and the Son as the Father is in the Son.</p>\n<p>I can think of no other good account that can be given of the apostle Paul's wishing grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ in the beginning of his Epistles, without ever mentioning the Holy Ghost, - as we find it thirteen times in his salutations in the beginnings of his Epistles, - but [i.e., except] that the Holy Ghost is Himself love and grace of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ; and in his blessing at the end of his second Epistle to the Corinthians where all three Persons are mentioned he wishes grace and love from the Son and the Father [except that] in the communion or the partaking of the Holy Ghost, the blessing is from the Father and the Son in the Holy Ghost. But the blessing from the Holy Ghost is Himself, the communication of Himself. Christ promises that He and the Father will love believers (John 14:21,23), but no mention is made of the Holy Ghost, and the love of Christ and the love of the Father are often distinctly mentioned, but never any mention of the Holy Ghost's love.</p>\n<p>(This I suppose to be the reason why we have never any account of the Holy Ghost's loving either the Father or the Son, or of the Son's or the Father's loving the Holy Ghost, or of the Holy Ghost's loving the saints, tho these things are so often predicated of both the other Persons.)</p>\n<p>And this I suppose to be that blessed Trinity that we read of in the Holy Scriptures. The Father is the Deity subsisting in the prime, un-originated and most absolute manner, or the Deity in its direct existence. The Son is the Deity generated by God's understanding, or having an idea of Himself and subsisting in that idea. The Holy Ghost is the Deity subsisting in act, or the Divine essence flowing out and breathed forth in God's Infinite love to and delight in Himself. And I believe the whole Divine essence does truly and distinctly subsist both in the Divine idea and Divine love, and that each of them are properly distinct Persons.</p>\n<p>It is a maxim amongst divines that everything that is in God is God which must be understood of real attributes and not of mere modalities. If a man should tell me that the immutability of God is God, or that the omnipresence of God and authority of God is God, I should not be able to think of any rational meaning of what he said. It hardly sounds to me proper to say that God's being without change is God, or that God's being everywhere is God, or that God's having a right of government over creatures is God.</p>\n<p>But if it be meant that the real attributes of God, viz., His understanding and love are God, then what we have said may in some measure explain how it is so, for Deity subsists in them distinctly; so they are distinct Divine Persons.</p>\n<p>One of the principal objections that I can think of against what has been supposed is concerning the Personality of the Holy Ghost - that this scheme of things does not seem well to consist with [the fact] that a person is that which hath understanding and will. If the three in the Godhead are Persons they doubtless each of them have understanding, but this makes the understanding one distinct person and love another. How therefore can this love be said to have understanding, (Here I would observe that divines have not been wont to suppose that these three had three distinct understandings, but all one and the same understanding.)</p>\n<p>In order to clear up this matter let it be considered that the whole Divine office is supposed truly and properly to subsist in each of these three, viz., God and His understanding and love, and that there is such a wonderful union between them that they are, after an ineffable and inconceivable manner, One in Another, so that One hath Another and they have communion in One Another and are as it were predicable One of Another; as Christ said of Himself and the Father &quot;I am in the Father and the Father in Me,&quot; so may it be said concerning all the Persons in the Trinity, the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father, the Holy Ghost is in the Father, and the Father in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost is in the Son, and the Son in the Holy Ghost, and the Father understands because the Son Who is the Divine understanding is in Him, the Father loves because the Holy Ghost is in Him, so the Son loves because the Holy Ghost is in Him and proceeds from Him, so the Holy Ghost or the Divine essence subsisting is Divine, but understands because the Son the Divine Idea is in Him.</p>\n<p>Understanding may be predicated of this love because it is the love of the understanding both objectively and subjectively. God loves the understanding and that understanding also flows out in love so that the Divine understanding is in the Deity subsisting in love. It is not a blind love. Even in creatures there is consciousness included in the very nature of the will or act of the soul, and tho perhaps not so that it can so properly be said that it is a seeing or undemanding will, yet it may truly and properly be said so in God by reason of God's infinitely more perfect manner of acting so that the whole Divine essence flows out and subsists in this act, and the Son is in the Holy Spirit tho it does not proceed from Him by reason ( of the fact) that the understanding must be considered as prior in the order of nature to the will or love or act, both in creatures and in the Creator. The understanding is so in the Spirit that the Spirit may be said to know, as the Spirit of God is truly and perfectly said to know and to search all things, even the deep things of God.</p>\n<p>(All the Three are Persons for they all have understanding and will. There is understanding and will in the Father, as the Son and the Holy Ghost are in Him and proceed from Him. There is understanding and will in the Son, as He is understanding and as the Holy Ghost is in Him and proceeds from Him. There is understanding and will in the Holy Ghost as He is the Divine will and as the Son is in Him.</p>\n<p>Nor is it to be looked upon as a strange and unreasonable figment that the Persons should be said to have an understanding or love by another person's being in them, for we have Scripture ground to conclude so concerning the Father's having wisdom and understanding or reason that it is by the Son's being in Him; because we are there informed that He is the wisdom and reason and truth of God, and hereby God is wise by His own wisdom being in Him. Understanding and wisdom is in the Father as the Son is in Him and proceeds from Him. Understanding is in the Holy Ghost because the Son is in Him, not as proceeding from Him but as flowing out in Him.)</p>\n<p>But I don't pretend fully to explain how these things are and I am sensible a hundred other objections may be made and puzzling doubts and questions raised that I can't solve. I am far from pretending to explaining the Trinity so as to render it no longer a mystery. I think it to be the highest and deepest of all Divine mysteries still, notwithstanding anything that I have said or conceived about it. I don't intend to explain the Trinity. But Scripture with reason may lead to say something further of it than has been wont to be said, tho there are still left many things pertaining to it incomprehensible.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that what I have here supposed concerning the Trinity is exceeding analogous to the Gospel scheme and agreeable to the tenor of the whole New Testament and abundantly illustrative of Gospel doctrines, as might be particularly shown, would it not exceedingly lengthen out this discourse.</p>\n<p>I shall only now briefly observe that many things that have been wont to be said by orthodox divines about the Trinity are hereby illustrated. Hereby we see how the Father is the fountain of the Godhead, and why when He is spoken of in Scripture He is so often, without any addition or distinction, called God, which has led some to think that He only was truly and properly God. Hereby we may see why in the economy of the Persons of the Trinity the Father should sustain the dignity of the Deity, that the Father should have it as His office to uphold and maintain the rights of the Godhead and should be God not only by essence, but as it were, by His economical office.</p>\n<p>Hereby is illustrated the doctrine of the Holy Ghost. Proceeding [from] both the Father and the Son. Hereby we see how that it is possible for the Son to be begotten by the Father and the Holy Ghost to proceed from the Father and Son, and yet that all the Persons should be Co-etemal. Hereby we may more clearly understand the equality of the Persons among themselves, and that they are every way equal in the society or family of the three.</p>\n<p>They are equal in honor: besides the honor which is common to them all, viz., that they are all God, each has His peculiar honor in the society or family. They are equal not only in essence, but the Father's honor is that He is, as it were, the Author of perfect and Infinite wisdom. The Son's honor is that He is that perfect and Divine wisdom itself the excellency of which is that from whence arises the honor of being the author or Generator of it. The honor of the Father and the Son is that they are infinitely excellent, or that from them infinite excellency proceeds; but the honor of the Holy Ghost is equal for He is that Divine excellency and beauty itself.\n'Tis the honor of the Father and the Son that they are infinitely holy and are the fountain of holiness, but the honor of the Holy Ghost is that holiness itself. The honor of the Father and the Son is [that] they are infinitely happy and are the original and fountain of happiness and the honor of the Holy Ghost is equal for He is infinite happiness and joy itself.</p>\n<p>The honor of the Father is that He is the fountain of the Deity as He from Whom proceed both the Divine wisdom and also excellency and happiness. The honor of the Son is equal for He is Himself the Divine wisdom and is He from Whom proceeds the Divine excellency and happiness, and the honor of the Holy Ghost is equal for He is the beauty and happiness of both the other Persons.</p>\n<p>By this also we may fully understand the equality of each Person's concern in the work of redemption, and the equality of the Redeemed's concern with them and dependence upon them, and the equality and honor and praise due to each of them. Glory belongs to the Father and the Son that they so greatly loved the world: to the Father that He so loved that He gave His Only Begotten Son: to the Son that He so loved the world as to give up Himself.\nBut there is equal glory due to the Holy Ghost for He is that love of the Father and the Son to the world. Just so much as the two first Persons glorify themselves by showing the astonishing greatness of their love and grace, just so much is that wonderful love and grace glorified Who is the Holy Ghost. It shows the Infinite dignity and excellency of the Father that the Son so delighted and prized His honor and glory that He stooped infinitely low rather than [that] men's salvation should be to the injury of that honor and glory.</p>\n<p>It showed the infinite excellency and worth of the Son that the Father so delighted in Him that for His sake He was ready to quit His anger and receive into favor those that had [deserved?] infinitely ill at His Hands, and what was done shows how great the excellency and worth of the Holy Ghost Who is that delight which the Father and the Son have in each other: it shows it to be Infinite. So great as the worth of a thing delighted in is to any one, so great is the worth of that delight and joy itself which he has in it.</p>\n<p>Our dependence is equally upon each in this office. The Father appoints and provides the Redeemer, and Himself accepts the price and grants the thing purchased; the Son is the Redeemer by offering Himself and is the price; and the Holy Ghost immediately communicates to us the thing purchased by communicating Himself, and He is the thing purchased. The sum of all that Christ purchased for men was the Holy Ghost: (Gal. 3:13,14) &quot;He was made a curse for us... that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&quot;</p>\n<p>What Christ purchased for us was that we have communion with God [which] is His good, which consists in partaking of the Holy Ghost: as we have shown, all the blessedness of the Redeemed consists in their partaking of Christ's fullness, which consists in partaking of that Spirit which is given not by measure unto him: the oil that is poured on the head of the Church runs down to the members of His body and to the skirts of His garment (Ps. 133:2). Christ purchased for us that we should have the favor of God and might enjoy His love, but this love is the Holy Ghost.</p>\n<p>Christ purchased for us true spiritual excellency, grace and holiness, the sum of which is love to God, which is [nothing] but the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the heart. Christ purchased for us spiritual joy and comfort, which is in a participation of God's joy and happiness, which joy and happiness is the Holy Ghost as we have shown. The Holy Ghost is the sum of all good things. Good things and the Holy Spirit are synonymous expressions in Scripture: (Matt. 7:11) &quot;How much more shall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him.&quot; The sum of all spiritual good which the finite have in this world is that spring of living water within them which we read of (John 4:10), and those rivers of living water flowing out of them which we read of (John 7:38,39), which we are there told means the Holy Ghost; and the sum of all happiness in the other world is that river of water of life which proceeds out of the throne of God and the Lamb, which we read of (Rev. 22:1), which is the River of God's pleasures and is the Holy Ghost and therefore the sum of the Gospel invitation to come and take the water of life (verse 17).</p>\n<p>The Holy Ghost is the purchased possession and inheritance of the saints, as appears because that little of it which the saints have in this world is said to be the earnest of that purchased inheritance. (Eph. 1:14) Tis an earnest of that which we are to have a fullness of hereafter. (II Cor. 1:22; 5:5) The Holy Ghost is the great subject of all Gospel promises and therefore is called the Spirit of promise. (Eph. 1:13) This is called the promise of the Father (Luke 24:49), and the like in other places. (If the Holy Ghost be a comprehension of all good things promised in the Gospel, we may easily see the force of the Apostle's arguing (Gal. 3:2), &quot;This only would I know, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?&quot;) So that it is God of Whom our good is purchased and it is God that purchases it and it is God also that is the thing purchased.</p>\n<p>Thus all our good things are of God and through God and in God, as we read in Romans 11:36: &quot;For of Him and through Him and to Him (or in Him as eis is rendered, I Cor. 8:6) are all things.&quot; &quot;To Whom be glory forever.&quot; All our good is of God the Father, it is all through God the Son, and all is in the Holy Ghost as He is Himself all our good. God is Himself the portion and purchased inheritance of His people. Thus God is the Alpha and the Omega in this affair of redemption.</p>\n<p>If we suppose no more than used to be supposed about the Holy Ghost, the concern of the Holy Ghost in the work of redemption is not equal with the Father's and the Son's, nor is there an equal part of the glory of this work belonging to Him: merely to apply to us or immediately to give or hand to us the blessing purchased, after it was purchased, as subservient to the other two Persons, is but a little thing [compared] to the purchasing of it by the paying an Infinite price, by Christ offering up Himself in sacrifice to procure it, and it is but a little thing to God the Father's giving His infinitely dear Son to be a sacrifice for us and upon His purchase to afford to us all the blessings of His purchased.</p>\n<p>But according to this there is an equality. To be the love of God to the world is as much as for the Father and the Son to do so much from love to the world, and to be the thing purchased was as much as to be the price. The price and the thing bought with that price are equal. And it is as much as to afford the thing purchased, for the glory that belongs to Him that affords the thing purchased arises from the worth of that thing that He affords and therefore it is the same glory and an equal glory; the glory of the thing itself is its worth and that is also the glory of him that affords it.</p>\n<p>There are two more eminent and remarkable images of the Trinity among the creatures. The one is in the spiritual creation, the soul of man. There is the mind, and the understanding or idea, and the spirit of the mind as it is called in Scripture, i.e., the disposition, the will or affection. The other is in the visible creation, viz., the Sun. The father is as the substance of the Sun. (By substance I don't mean in a philosophical sense, but the Sun as to its internal constitution.) The Son is as the brightness and glory of the disk of the Sun or that bright and glorious form under which it appears to our eyes. The Holy Ghost is the action of the Sun which is within the Sun in its intestine heat, and, being diffusive, enlightens, warms, enlivens and comforts the world. The Spirit as it is God's Infinite love to Himself and happiness in Himself, is as the internal heat of the Sun, but as it is that by which God communicates Himself, it is as the emanation of the sun's action, or the emitted beams of the sun.</p>\n<p>The various sorts of rays of the sun and their beautiful colors do well represent the Spirit. They well represent the love and grace of God and were made use of for this purpose in the rainbow after the flood, and I suppose also in that rainbow that was seen round about the throne by Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:28; Rev. 4:3) and round the head of Christ by John (Rev. 10:1), or the amiable excellency of God and the various beautiful graces and virtues of the Spirit. These beautiful colors of the sunbeams we find made use of in Scripture for this purpose, viz., to represent the graces of the Spirit, as (Ps. 68:13) &quot;Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold,&quot; i.e., like the light reflected in various beautiful colors from the feathers of a dove, which colors represent the graces of the Heavenly Dove.</p>\n<p>The same I suppose is signified by the various beautiful colors reflected from the precious stones of the breastplate, and that these spiritual ornaments of the Church are what are represented by the various colors of the foundation and gates of the new Jerusalem (Rev. 21; Isaiah 54:11, etc.) and the stones of the Temple (I Chron. 29: 2); and I believe the variety there is in the rays of the Sun and their beautiful colors was designed by the Creator for this very purpose, and indeed that the whole visible creation which is but the shadow of being is so made and ordered by God as to typify and represent spiritual things, for which I could give many reasons. (I don't propose this merely as an hypothesis but as a part of Divine truth sufficiently and fully ascertained by the revelation God has made in the Holy Scriptures.)</p>\n<p>I am sensible what kind of objections many will be ready to make against what has been said, what difficulties will be immediately found, How can this be? And how can that be!</p>\n<p>I am far from affording this as any explication of this mystery, that unfolds and renews the mysteriousness and incomprehensibleness of it, for I am sensible that however by what has been said some difficulties are lessened, others that are new appear, and the number of those things that appear mysterious, wonderful and incomprehensible, is increased by it. I offer it only as a farther manifestation of what of Divine truth the Word of God exhibits to the view of our minds concerning this great mystery.</p>\n<p>I think the Word of God teaches us more things concerning it to be believed by us than have been generally believed, and that it exhibits many things concerning it exceeding [i.e., more] glorious and wonderful than have been taken notice of; yea, that it reveals or exhibits many more wonderful mysteries than those which have been taken notice of; which mysteries that have been overvalued are incomprehensible things and yet have been exhibited in the Word of God tho they are an addition to the number of mysteries that are in it. No wonder that the more things we are told concerning that which is so infinitely above our reach, the number of visible mysteries increases.</p>\n<p>When we tell a child a little concerning God he has not an hundredth part so many mysteries in view on the nature and attributes of God and His works of creation and Providence as one that is told much concerning God in a Divinity School; and yet he knows much more about God and has a much clearer understanding of things of Divinity and is able more clearly to explicate some things that were dark and very unintelligible to him; I humbly apprehend that the things that have been observed increase the number of visible mysteries in the Godhead in no other manner than as by them we perceive that God has told us much more about it than was before generally observed.</p>\n<p>Under the Old Testament the Church of God was not told near so much about the Trinity as they are now. But what the New Testament has revealed, tho it has more opened to our view the nature of God, yet it has increased the number of visible mysteries and they thus appear to us exceeding wonderful and incomprehensible. And so also it has come to pass in the Church being told [i.e., that the churches are told] more about the incarnation and the satisfaction of Christ and other Gospel doctrines.</p>\n<p>It is so not only in Divine things but natural things. He that looks on a plant, or the parts of the bodies of animals, or any other works of nature, at a great distance where he has but an obscure sight-of it, may see something in it wonderful and beyond his comprehension, but he that is near to it and views them narrowly indeed understands more about them, has a clearer and distinct sight of them, and yet the number of things that are wonderful and mysterious in them that appear to him are much more than before, and, if he views them with a microscope, the number of the wonders that he sees will be increased still but yet the microscope gives him more a true knowledge concerning them.</p>\n<p>God is never said to love the Holy Ghost nor are any epithets that betoken love anywhere given to Him, tho so many are ascribed to the Son, as God's Elect, The Beloved, He in Whom God's soul delights, He in Whom He is well pleased, etc. Yea such epithets seem to be ascribed to the Son as tho He were the object of love exclusive of all other persons, as tho there were no person whatsoever to share the love of the Father with the Son. To this purpose evidently He is called God's Only Begotten Son, at the time that it is added, &quot;In Whom He is well pleased.&quot; There is nothing in Scripture that speaks of any acceptance of the Holy Ghost or any reward or any mutual friendship between the Holy Ghost and either of the other Persons, or any command to love the Holy Ghost or to delight in or have any complacence in [the Holy Ghost], tho such commands are so frequent with respect to the other Persons.</p>\n<p>That knowledge or understanding in God which we must conceive of as first is His knowledge of everything possible. That love which must be this knowledge is what we must conceive of as belonging to the essence of the Godhead in it's first subsistence. Then comes a reflex act of knowledge and His viewing Himself and knowing Himself and so knowing His own knowledge and so the Son is begotten. There is such a thing in God as knowledge of knowledge, an idea of an idea. Which can be nothing else than the idea or knowledge repeated.</p>\n<p>The world was made for the Son of God especially. For God made the world for Himself from love to Himself; but God loves Himself only in a reflex act. He views Himself and so loves Himself, so He makes the world for Himself viewed and reflected on, and that is. The same with Himself repeated or begotten in His own idea, and that is His Son. When God considers of making any thing for Himself He presents Himself before Himself and views Himself as His End, and that viewing Himself is the same as reflecting on Himself or having an idea of Himself, and to make the world for the Godhead thus viewed and understood is to make the world for the Godhead begotten and that is to make the world for the Son of God.</p>\n<p>The love of God as it flows forth ad extra is wholly determined and directed by Divine wisdom, so that those only are the objects of it that Divine wisdom chooses, so that the creation of the world is to gratify Divine love as that is exercised by Divine wisdom. But Christ is Divine wisdom so that the world is made to gratify Divine love as exercised by Christ or to gratify the love that is in Christ's heart, or to provide a spouse for Christ. Those creatures which wisdom chooses for the object of Divine love as Christ's elect spouse and especially those elect creatures that wisdom chiefly pitches upon and makes the end of the rest of creatures.</p>\n","parentDir":"2016-03-11, Essay on the Trinity","baseid":"33f8978b3a","id":"9804af95ac","slug":"2016-03-10_essay-on-the-trinity","tagmatches":[{"id":"245f7f89ec","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Developing a Good Heart","slug":"2018-11-17_developing-a-good-heart","language":"en","author":"Dalai Lama","img":"Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg"},{"id":"0e751aa3b8","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Thomas Merton Memoirs about Interfaith","slug":"2016-10-26_thomas-merton-memoirs-about-interfaith","language":"en","author":"Thomas Merton","img":"Dhirendra-Brahmachari.jpeg"},{"id":"3fd17b3349","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"An Indian Folk Religion","slug":"2016-08-13_an-indian-folk-religion","language":"en","author":"Rabindranath Tagore","img":"46122bc4dca93e61413c2e750ca0974b.jpg"},{"id":"a4d7127f1a","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Be Like Adam’s Son","slug":"2016-08-01_be-like-adams-son","language":"en","author":"Jawdat Sa’eed","img":"adam-and-eve-with-the-infants-cain-and-abel-lorenzo-de-ferrari.jpg"}],"previnfo":{"id":"a4d7127f1a","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Be Like Adam’s Son","slug":"2016-08-01_be-like-adams-son","language":"en","author":"Jawdat Sa’eed","img":"adam-and-eve-with-the-infants-cain-and-abel-lorenzo-de-ferrari.jpg"},"nextinfo":{"id":"9cdfe9f2c7","tags":"race,vision","title":"I have a Dream","slug":"2019-02-10_i-have-a-dream","language":"en","author":"Martin Luther King Jr.","img":"Martin-Luther-King.jpg"}},{"file":"/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/Private Apps/sacred_traditions.org/src/content/articles/2016-03-11, Essay on the Trinity/2016-03-11_Essay-on-the-Trinity_it.md","title":"Essay on the Trinity IT","author":"Jonathan Edwards","pubdate":"2016-03-10","language":"it","likes":74,"tags":"sit amet,consectetur","img":"2000px-Society_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Most_Holy_Trinity_badge.svg.png","category":"trinity","snip":"Dico sempre alla gente che la mia religione è gentile, perché la gentilezza è \"nelle nostre ossa\". Senza gentilezza nessuno di noi potrebbe sopravvivere. Quando nasciamo siamo accolti con gentilezza e compassione.","html":"\n<h1>Sviluppare un buon cuore, dal Dalai Lama</h1>\n<p>Dico sempre alla gente che la mia religione è gentile, perché la gentilezza è &quot;nelle nostre ossa&quot;. Senza gentilezza nessuno di noi potrebbe sopravvivere. Quando nasciamo siamo accolti con gentilezza e compassione. A causa della gentilezza degli altri, abbiamo cibo, riparo, vestiti e medicine, tutto ciò di cui abbiamo bisogno per sopravvivere. Da bambini, sotto la cura degli altri, riceviamo un'educazione e apprendiamo i buoni valori che ci aiutano nella vita. Avendo goduto dei benefici della gentilezza degli altri, è naturale che lo rimborsiamo.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, a volte il nostro senso di interesse personale ci impedisce di farlo. Inoltre, alcune persone dicono che siamo geneticamente predisposti a cercare il nostro beneficio indipendentemente dagli altri. Non credo che abbiamo bisogno di essere confinati da istinti così semplici. È naturale per noi perseguire i nostri interessi, ma dobbiamo farlo in modo saggio, non sciocco. E il saggio è prendere in considerazione anche gli altri.</p>\n<p>Oggi, sempre più scienziati stanno scoprendo che coltivare coscientemente la compassione ha un ruolo positivo nella funzione cerebrale e rafforza percorsi neuronali particolari. In altre parole, i nostri meravigliosi cervelli umani possono essere trasformati nel processo di coltivare le nostre migliori qualità - come la generosità, la compassione, l'amore, la tolleranza, il perdono, la fortezza, la pazienza e la saggezza. E gli antichi metodi basati sulla ragione che il Buddha ha insegnato per rilasciare emozioni disturbanti e coltivare emozioni positive possono fornire un modo per farlo.</p>\n<h1>Saggio sulla Trinità</h1>\n<p>È COMUNE quando si parla della felicità divina per dire che Dio è infinitamente felice nel godimento di se stesso, nella contemplazione perfetta e nell'amore infinito e nella gioia della sua stessa essenza e perfezione, e di conseguenza deve essere supposto che Dio sia perennemente ed eternamente ha una perfetta idea di Se stesso, come se fosse un'immagine e rappresentazione esatta di Se stesso prima di Lui e nella visione reale, e da qui sorge un atto o un'energia più pura e perfetta nella Divinità, che è l'amore divino, la compiacenza e gioia. La conoscenza o visione che Dio ha di Se stesso deve necessariamente essere concepita per essere qualcosa di distinto dalla Sua semplice esistenza diretta. Ci deve essere qualcosa che risponda alla nostra riflessione. Il riflesso mentre riflettiamo sulla nostra mente porta in sé qualcosa di imperfezione. Tuttavia, se Dio vede Se stesso in modo da avere gioia e gioia in se stesso, deve diventare il suo oggetto. Ci deve essere una doppiezza. C'è Dio e l'idea di Dio, se è corretto chiamare una concezione di ciò che è un'idea puramente spirituale.</p>\n<p>Se un uomo potesse avere un'idea assolutamente perfetta di tutto ciò che gli passava per la mente, tutte le serie di idee ed esercizi in ogni senso, perfetti per ordine, grado, circostanza e per ogni particolare spazio del passato, supponiamo che l'ultima ora, lui sarebbe davvero a tutti gli effetti e scopo essere di nuovo quello che era quell'ultima ora. E se fosse possibile per un uomo con la riflessione perfettamente contemplare tutto ciò che è nella sua mente in un'ora, com'è e nello stesso tempo che è lì nella sua prima e diretta esistenza; se un uomo, cioè, avesse un riflesso perfetto o un'idea contemplativa di ogni pensiero nello stesso momento o nei momenti in cui quel pensiero era e di ogni esercizio nello stesso momento in cui quell'esercizio era, e così per un'ora intera, un l'uomo sarebbe davvero due in quel periodo, sarebbe davvero il doppio, sarebbe due volte in una volta. L'idea che ha di se stesso sarebbe di nuovo se stessa.</p>\n<p>Nota, avendo un riflesso o un'idea contemplativa di ciò che passa nelle nostre menti, non intendo solo la coscienza. C'è una grande differenza tra l'uomo che ha una visione di se stesso, un'idea riflessiva o contemplativa di se stesso in modo da deliziare la propria bellezza o eccellenza e una semplice coscienza diretta. O se intendiamo per coscienza di ciò che è nella nostra mente qualcosa oltre alla semplice esistenza semplice nella nostra mente di ciò che è lì, non è altro che un potere di riflessione per vedere o contemplare ciò che passa.</p>\n<p>Quindi, come Dio con perfetta chiarezza, pienezza e forza, comprende Se stesso, vede la propria essenza (in cui non c'è distinzione di sostanza e di azione, ma che è interamente sostanza e atto completo), quell'idea che Dio ha di se stesso è assolutamente se stesso. Questa rappresentazione della natura e dell'essenza divina è di nuovo la natura divina e l'essenza: così che certamente il pensiero divino della divinità deve essere generato. Con la presente vi è un'altra persona generata, c'è un altro infinito Eterno Onnipotente e santissimo e lo stesso Dio, la stessa natura divina.</p>\n<p>E questa Persona è la seconda persona nella Trinità, l'Unigenito e amato Figlio di Dio; È l'idea eterna, necessaria, perfetta, sostanziale e personale che Dio ha di se stesso; e che mi sembra così abbondantemente confermato dalla Parola di Dio.</p>\n<p>Nothing can more agree with the account the Scripture gives us of the Son of God, His being in the form of God and His express and perfect image and representation: (II Cor. 4:4) &quot;Lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ Who is the image of God should shine unto them.&quot; (Phil. 2:6) &quot;Who being in the form of God.&quot; (Col. 1:15) &quot;Who is the image of the invisible God.&quot; (Heb. 1:3) &quot;Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person.&quot;</p>\n<p>Christ is called the face of God (Exod. 33:14): the word [A.V. presence] in the original signifies face, looks, form or appearance. Now what can be so properly and fitly called so with respect to God as God's own perfect idea of Himself whereby He has every moment a view of His own essence: this idea is that &quot;face of God&quot; which God sees as a man sees his own face in a looking glass. 'Tis of such form or appearance whereby God eternally appears to Himself. The root that the original word comes from signifies to look upon or behold: now what is that which God looks upon or beholds in so eminent a manner as He doth on His own idea or that perfect image of Himself which He has in view. This is what is eminently in God's presence and is therefore called the angel of God's presence or face (Isa. 63:9). But that the Son of God is God's own eternal and perfect idea is a thing we have yet much more expressly revealed in God's Word. First, in that Christ is called &quot;the wisdom of God.&quot; If we are taught in the Scripture that Christ is the same with God's wisdom or knowledge, then it teaches us that He is the same with God's perfect and eternal idea. They are the same as we have already observed and I suppose none will deny. But Christ is said to be the wisdom of God (I Cor. 1:24, Luke 11:49, compare with Matt. 23:34); and how much doth Christ speak in Proverbs under the name of Wisdom especially in the 8th chapter.</p>\n<p>The Godhead being thus begotten by God's loving an idea of Himself and shewing forth in a distinct subsistence or person in that idea, there proceeds a most pure act, and an infinitely holy and sacred energy arises between the Father and Son in mutually loving and delighting in each other, for their love and joy is mutual, (Prov. 8:30) &quot;I was daily His delight rejoicing always before Him.&quot; This is the eternal and most perfect and essential act of the Divine nature, wherein the Godhead acts to an infinite degree and in the most perfect manner possible. The Deity becomes all act, the Divine essence itself flows out and is as it were breathed forth in love and joy. So that the Godhead therein stands forth in yet another manner of subsistence, and there proceeds the third Person in the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, viz., the Deity in act, for there is no other act but the act of the will.</p>\n<p>We may learn by the Word of God that the Godhead or the Divine nature and essence does subsist in love. (I John 4:8) &quot;He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.&quot; In the context of which place I think it is plainly intimated to us that the Holy Spirit is that Love, as in the 12th and 13th verses. &quot;If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His love is perfected in us; hereby know we that we dwell in Him ... because He hath given us of His Spirit.&quot; 'Tis the same argument in both verses. In the 12th verse the apostle argues that if we have love dwelling in us we have God dwelling in us, and in the 13th verse He clears the force of the argument by this that love is God's Spirit. Seeing we have God's Spirit dwelling in us, we have God dwelling in [in us], supposing it as a thing granted and allowed that God's Spirit is God. 'Tis evident also by this that God's dwelling in us and His love or the love that He hath exerciseth, being in us, are the same thing. The same is intimated in the same manner in the last verse of the foregoing chapter. The apostle was, in the foregoing verses, speaking of love as a sure sign of sincerity and our acceptance with God, beginning with the 18th verse, and he sums up the argument thus in the last verse, &quot;and hereby do we know that He abideth in us by the Spirit that He hath given us.&quot;</p>\n<p>The Scripture seems in many places to speak of love in Christians as if it were the same with the Spirit of God in them, or at least as the prime and most natural breathing and acting of the Spirit in the soul. (Phil. 2:1) &quot;If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, any comfort of love, any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels of mercies, fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.&quot; (II Cor. 6:6) &quot;By kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned.&quot; (Romans 15:30) &quot;Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit.&quot; (Col. 1:8) &quot;Who declared unto us your love in the Spirit.&quot; (Rom. 5:5) &quot;Having the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.&quot; (Gal. 5:13-16) &quot;Use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.&quot; The Apostle argues that Christian liberty does not make way for fulfilling the lusts of the flesh in biting and devouring one another and the like, because a principle of love which was the fulfilling of the law would prevent it, and in the 16th verse he asserts the same thing in other words: &quot;This I say then walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.&quot;</p>\n<p>The third and last office of the Holy Spirit is to comfort and delight the souls of God's people, and thus one of His names is the Comforter, and thus we have the phrase of &quot;joy in the Holy Ghost.&quot; (I Thess. 1:6) &quot;Having received the Word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost.&quot; (Rom. 14: 17) &quot;The kingdom of God is ... righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.&quot; (Acts 9:31) &quot;Walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.&quot; But how well doth this agree with the Holy Ghost being God's joy and delight, (Acts 13:52) &quot;And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost&quot;--meaning as I suppose that they were filled with spiritual joy.</p>\n<p>This is confirmed by the symbol of the Holy Ghost, viz., a dove, which is the emblem of love or a lover, and is so used in Scripture, and especially often so in Solomon's Song, (1:15) &quot;Behold thou art fair; my love, behold thou art fair; thou hast dove's eyes:&quot; i.e. &quot;Eyes of love,&quot; and again 4:1, the same words; and 5:12, &quot;His eyes are as the eyes of doves,&quot; and 5:2, &quot;My love, my dove,&quot; and 2:14 and 6:9; and this I believe to be the reason that the dove alone of all birds (except the sparrow in the single case of the leprosy) was appointed to be offered in sacrifice because of its innocence and because it is the emblem of love, love being the most acceptable sacrifice to God. It was under this similitude that the Holy Ghost descended from the Father on Christ at His baptism, signifying the infinite love of the Father to the Son, Who is the true David, or beloved, as we said before.</p>\n<p>The same was signified by what was exhibited to the eye in the appearance there was of the Holy Ghost descending from the Father to the Son in the shape of a dove, as was signified by what was exhibited to the eye in the voice there was at the same time, viz., &quot;This is My well Beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased.&quot;</p>\n<p>(That God's love or His loving kindness is the same with the Holy Ghost seems to be plain by Psalm 36:7-9, &quot;How excellent (or how precious as 'tis in the Hebrew) is Thy loving-kindness O God, therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Thy wings, they shall be abundantly satisfied (in the Hebrew &quot;watered&quot;) with the fatness of Thy house and Thou shalt make them to drink of the river of Thy pleasures; for with Thee is the fountain of life and in Thy light shall we see light.&quot;</p>\n<p>Doubtless that precious loving-kindness and that fatness of God's house and river of His pleasures and the water of the fountain of life and God's light here spoken [of] are the same thing; by which we learn that the Holy anointing oil that was kept in the House of God, which was a type of the Holy Ghost, represented God's love, and that the &quot;River of water of life&quot; spoken of in the 22nd [chapter] of Revelation, which proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, which is the same with Ezekiel's vision of Living and life-giving water, which is here [in Ps. 36] called the &quot;Fountain of life and river of God's pleasures,&quot; is God's loving-kindness.</p>\n<p>But Christ Himself expressly teaches us that by spiritual fountains and rivers of water of life is meant the Holy Ghost. (John 4:14; 7:38,39).That by the river of God's pleasures here is meant the same thing with the pure river of water of life spoken of in Revelation 22:1, will be much confirmed if we compare those verses with Revelation 21:23, 24; 22:1,5. (See the notes on chapters 21, 23, 24) I think if we compare these places and weigh them we cannot doubt but that it is the same happiness that is meant in this Psalm which is spoken of there.)</p>\n<p>So this well agrees with the similitudes and metaphors that are used about the Holy Ghost in Scripture, such as water, fire, breath, wind, oil, wine, a spring, a river, a being poured out and shed forth, and a being breathed forth. Can there any spiritual thing be thought, or anything belonging to any spiritual being to which such kind of metaphors so naturally agree, as to the affection of a Spirit. The affection, love or joy, may be said to flow out as water or to be breathed forth as breath or wind. But it would [not] sound so well to say that an idea or judgment flows out or is breathed forth.\nIt is no way different to say of the affection that it is warm, or to compare love to fire, but it would not seem natural to say the same of perception or reason. It seems natural enough to say that the soul is poured out in affection or that love or delight are shed abroad: (Rom. 5:5) &quot;The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts,&quot; but it suits with nothing else belonging to a spiritual being.</p>\n<p>This is that &quot;river of water of life&quot; spoken of in the 22nd [chapter] of Revelation, which proceeds from the throne of the Father and the Son, for the rivers of living water or water of life are the Holy Ghost, by the same apostle's own interpretation (John 7:38, 39); and the Holy Ghost being the infinite delight and pleasure of God, the river is called the river of God's pleasures (Ps. 36:8), not God's river of pleasures, which I suppose signifies the same as the fatness of God's House, which they that trust in God shall be watered with, by which fatness of God's House I suppose is signified the same thing which oil typifies.</p>\n<p>It is a confirmation that the Holy Ghost is God's love and delight, because the saints communion with God consists in their partaking of the Holy Ghost. The communion of saints is twofold: 'tis their communion with God and communion with one another, (I John 1:3) &quot;That ye also may have fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.&quot; Communion is a common partaking of good, either of excellency or happiness, so that when it is said the saints have communion or fellowship with the Father and with the Son, the meaning of it is that they partake with the Father and the Son of their good, which is either their excellency and glory (II Peter 1:4), &quot;Ye are made partakers of the Divine nature&quot;; Heb. 12:10, &quot;That we might be partakers of His holiness;&quot; John 17:22, 23, &quot;And the glory which Thou hast given Me I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one, I in them and Thou in Me&quot;); or of their joy and happiness: (John 17:13) &quot;That they might have My joy fulfilled in themselves.&quot;\nBut the Holy Ghost being the love and joy of God is His beauty and happiness, and it is in our partaking of the same Holy Spirit that our communion with God consists: (II Cor. 13:14) &quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all, Amen.&quot; They are not different benefits but the same that the Apostle here wisheth, viz., the Holy Ghost: in partaking of the Holy Ghost, we possess and enjoy the love and grace of the Father and the Son, for the Holy Ghost is that love and grace, and therefore I suppose it is that in that forementioned place, (I John 1:3). We are said to have fellowship with the Son and not with the Holy Ghost, because therein consists our fellowship with the Father and the Son, even in partaking with them of the Holy Ghost.</p>\n<p>In this also eminently consists our communion with the Son that we drink into the same Spirit. This is the common excellency and joy and happiness in which they all are united; 'tis the bond of perfectness by which they are one in the Father and the Son as the Father is in the Son.</p>\n<p>I can think of no other good account that can be given of the apostle Paul's wishing grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ in the beginning of his Epistles, without ever mentioning the Holy Ghost, - as we find it thirteen times in his salutations in the beginnings of his Epistles, - but [i.e., except] that the Holy Ghost is Himself love and grace of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ; and in his blessing at the end of his second Epistle to the Corinthians where all three Persons are mentioned he wishes grace and love from the Son and the Father [except that] in the communion or the partaking of the Holy Ghost, the blessing is from the Father and the Son in the Holy Ghost. But the blessing from the Holy Ghost is Himself, the communication of Himself. Christ promises that He and the Father will love believers (John 14:21,23), but no mention is made of the Holy Ghost, and the love of Christ and the love of the Father are often distinctly mentioned, but never any mention of the Holy Ghost's love.</p>\n<p>(This I suppose to be the reason why we have never any account of the Holy Ghost's loving either the Father or the Son, or of the Son's or the Father's loving the Holy Ghost, or of the Holy Ghost's loving the saints, tho these things are so often predicated of both the other Persons.)</p>\n<p>And this I suppose to be that blessed Trinity that we read of in the Holy Scriptures. The Father is the Deity subsisting in the prime, un-originated and most absolute manner, or the Deity in its direct existence. The Son is the Deity generated by God's understanding, or having an idea of Himself and subsisting in that idea. The Holy Ghost is the Deity subsisting in act, or the Divine essence flowing out and breathed forth in God's Infinite love to and delight in Himself. And I believe the whole Divine essence does truly and distinctly subsist both in the Divine idea and Divine love, and that each of them are properly distinct Persons.</p>\n<p>It is a maxim amongst divines that everything that is in God is God which must be understood of real attributes and not of mere modalities. If a man should tell me that the immutability of God is God, or that the omnipresence of God and authority of God is God, I should not be able to think of any rational meaning of what he said. It hardly sounds to me proper to say that God's being without change is God, or that God's being everywhere is God, or that God's having a right of government over creatures is God.</p>\n<p>But if it be meant that the real attributes of God, viz., His understanding and love are God, then what we have said may in some measure explain how it is so, for Deity subsists in them distinctly; so they are distinct Divine Persons.</p>\n<p>One of the principal objections that I can think of against what has been supposed is concerning the Personality of the Holy Ghost - that this scheme of things does not seem well to consist with [the fact] that a person is that which hath understanding and will. If the three in the Godhead are Persons they doubtless each of them have understanding, but this makes the understanding one distinct person and love another. How therefore can this love be said to have understanding, (Here I would observe that divines have not been wont to suppose that these three had three distinct understandings, but all one and the same understanding.)</p>\n<p>In order to clear up this matter let it be considered that the whole Divine office is supposed truly and properly to subsist in each of these three, viz., God and His understanding and love, and that there is such a wonderful union between them that they are, after an ineffable and inconceivable manner, One in Another, so that One hath Another and they have communion in One Another and are as it were predicable One of Another; as Christ said of Himself and the Father &quot;I am in the Father and the Father in Me,&quot; so may it be said concerning all the Persons in the Trinity, the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father, the Holy Ghost is in the Father, and the Father in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost is in the Son, and the Son in the Holy Ghost, and the Father understands because the Son Who is the Divine understanding is in Him, the Father loves because the Holy Ghost is in Him, so the Son loves because the Holy Ghost is in Him and proceeds from Him, so the Holy Ghost or the Divine essence subsisting is Divine, but understands because the Son the Divine Idea is in Him.</p>\n<p>Understanding may be predicated of this love because it is the love of the understanding both objectively and subjectively. God loves the understanding and that understanding also flows out in love so that the Divine understanding is in the Deity subsisting in love. It is not a blind love. Even in creatures there is consciousness included in the very nature of the will or act of the soul, and tho perhaps not so that it can so properly be said that it is a seeing or undemanding will, yet it may truly and properly be said so in God by reason of God's infinitely more perfect manner of acting so that the whole Divine essence flows out and subsists in this act, and the Son is in the Holy Spirit tho it does not proceed from Him by reason ( of the fact) that the understanding must be considered as prior in the order of nature to the will or love or act, both in creatures and in the Creator. The understanding is so in the Spirit that the Spirit may be said to know, as the Spirit of God is truly and perfectly said to know and to search all things, even the deep things of God.</p>\n<p>(All the Three are Persons for they all have understanding and will. There is understanding and will in the Father, as the Son and the Holy Ghost are in Him and proceed from Him. There is understanding and will in the Son, as He is understanding and as the Holy Ghost is in Him and proceeds from Him. There is understanding and will in the Holy Ghost as He is the Divine will and as the Son is in Him.</p>\n<p>Nor is it to be looked upon as a strange and unreasonable figment that the Persons should be said to have an understanding or love by another person's being in them, for we have Scripture ground to conclude so concerning the Father's having wisdom and understanding or reason that it is by the Son's being in Him; because we are there informed that He is the wisdom and reason and truth of God, and hereby God is wise by His own wisdom being in Him. Understanding and wisdom is in the Father as the Son is in Him and proceeds from Him. Understanding is in the Holy Ghost because the Son is in Him, not as proceeding from Him but as flowing out in Him.)</p>\n<p>But I don't pretend fully to explain how these things are and I am sensible a hundred other objections may be made and puzzling doubts and questions raised that I can't solve. I am far from pretending to explaining the Trinity so as to render it no longer a mystery. I think it to be the highest and deepest of all Divine mysteries still, notwithstanding anything that I have said or conceived about it. I don't intend to explain the Trinity. But Scripture with reason may lead to say something further of it than has been wont to be said, tho there are still left many things pertaining to it incomprehensible.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that what I have here supposed concerning the Trinity is exceeding analogous to the Gospel scheme and agreeable to the tenor of the whole New Testament and abundantly illustrative of Gospel doctrines, as might be particularly shown, would it not exceedingly lengthen out this discourse.</p>\n<p>I shall only now briefly observe that many things that have been wont to be said by orthodox divines about the Trinity are hereby illustrated. Hereby we see how the Father is the fountain of the Godhead, and why when He is spoken of in Scripture He is so often, without any addition or distinction, called God, which has led some to think that He only was truly and properly God. Hereby we may see why in the economy of the Persons of the Trinity the Father should sustain the dignity of the Deity, that the Father should have it as His office to uphold and maintain the rights of the Godhead and should be God not only by essence, but as it were, by His economical office.</p>\n<p>Hereby is illustrated the doctrine of the Holy Ghost. Proceeding [from] both the Father and the Son. Hereby we see how that it is possible for the Son to be begotten by the Father and the Holy Ghost to proceed from the Father and Son, and yet that all the Persons should be Co-etemal. Hereby we may more clearly understand the equality of the Persons among themselves, and that they are every way equal in the society or family of the three.</p>\n<p>They are equal in honor: besides the honor which is common to them all, viz., that they are all God, each has His peculiar honor in the society or family. They are equal not only in essence, but the Father's honor is that He is, as it were, the Author of perfect and Infinite wisdom. The Son's honor is that He is that perfect and Divine wisdom itself the excellency of which is that from whence arises the honor of being the author or Generator of it. The honor of the Father and the Son is that they are infinitely excellent, or that from them infinite excellency proceeds; but the honor of the Holy Ghost is equal for He is that Divine excellency and beauty itself.\n'Tis the honor of the Father and the Son that they are infinitely holy and are the fountain of holiness, but the honor of the Holy Ghost is that holiness itself. The honor of the Father and the Son is [that] they are infinitely happy and are the original and fountain of happiness and the honor of the Holy Ghost is equal for He is infinite happiness and joy itself.</p>\n<p>The honor of the Father is that He is the fountain of the Deity as He from Whom proceed both the Divine wisdom and also excellency and happiness. The honor of the Son is equal for He is Himself the Divine wisdom and is He from Whom proceeds the Divine excellency and happiness, and the honor of the Holy Ghost is equal for He is the beauty and happiness of both the other Persons.</p>\n<p>By this also we may fully understand the equality of each Person's concern in the work of redemption, and the equality of the Redeemed's concern with them and dependence upon them, and the equality and honor and praise due to each of them. Glory belongs to the Father and the Son that they so greatly loved the world: to the Father that He so loved that He gave His Only Begotten Son: to the Son that He so loved the world as to give up Himself.\nBut there is equal glory due to the Holy Ghost for He is that love of the Father and the Son to the world. Just so much as the two first Persons glorify themselves by showing the astonishing greatness of their love and grace, just so much is that wonderful love and grace glorified Who is the Holy Ghost. It shows the Infinite dignity and excellency of the Father that the Son so delighted and prized His honor and glory that He stooped infinitely low rather than [that] men's salvation should be to the injury of that honor and glory.</p>\n<p>It showed the infinite excellency and worth of the Son that the Father so delighted in Him that for His sake He was ready to quit His anger and receive into favor those that had [deserved?] infinitely ill at His Hands, and what was done shows how great the excellency and worth of the Holy Ghost Who is that delight which the Father and the Son have in each other: it shows it to be Infinite. So great as the worth of a thing delighted in is to any one, so great is the worth of that delight and joy itself which he has in it.</p>\n<p>Our dependence is equally upon each in this office. The Father appoints and provides the Redeemer, and Himself accepts the price and grants the thing purchased; the Son is the Redeemer by offering Himself and is the price; and the Holy Ghost immediately communicates to us the thing purchased by communicating Himself, and He is the thing purchased. The sum of all that Christ purchased for men was the Holy Ghost: (Gal. 3:13,14) &quot;He was made a curse for us... that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&quot;</p>\n<p>What Christ purchased for us was that we have communion with God [which] is His good, which consists in partaking of the Holy Ghost: as we have shown, all the blessedness of the Redeemed consists in their partaking of Christ's fullness, which consists in partaking of that Spirit which is given not by measure unto him: the oil that is poured on the head of the Church runs down to the members of His body and to the skirts of His garment (Ps. 133:2). Christ purchased for us that we should have the favor of God and might enjoy His love, but this love is the Holy Ghost.</p>\n<p>Christ purchased for us true spiritual excellency, grace and holiness, the sum of which is love to God, which is [nothing] but the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the heart. Christ purchased for us spiritual joy and comfort, which is in a participation of God's joy and happiness, which joy and happiness is the Holy Ghost as we have shown. The Holy Ghost is the sum of all good things. Good things and the Holy Spirit are synonymous expressions in Scripture: (Matt. 7:11) &quot;How much more shall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him.&quot; The sum of all spiritual good which the finite have in this world is that spring of living water within them which we read of (John 4:10), and those rivers of living water flowing out of them which we read of (John 7:38,39), which we are there told means the Holy Ghost; and the sum of all happiness in the other world is that river of water of life which proceeds out of the throne of God and the Lamb, which we read of (Rev. 22:1), which is the River of God's pleasures and is the Holy Ghost and therefore the sum of the Gospel invitation to come and take the water of life (verse 17).</p>\n<p>The Holy Ghost is the purchased possession and inheritance of the saints, as appears because that little of it which the saints have in this world is said to be the earnest of that purchased inheritance. (Eph. 1:14) Tis an earnest of that which we are to have a fullness of hereafter. (II Cor. 1:22; 5:5) The Holy Ghost is the great subject of all Gospel promises and therefore is called the Spirit of promise. (Eph. 1:13) This is called the promise of the Father (Luke 24:49), and the like in other places. (If the Holy Ghost be a comprehension of all good things promised in the Gospel, we may easily see the force of the Apostle's arguing (Gal. 3:2), &quot;This only would I know, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?&quot;) So that it is God of Whom our good is purchased and it is God that purchases it and it is God also that is the thing purchased.</p>\n<p>Thus all our good things are of God and through God and in God, as we read in Romans 11:36: &quot;For of Him and through Him and to Him (or in Him as eis is rendered, I Cor. 8:6) are all things.&quot; &quot;To Whom be glory forever.&quot; All our good is of God the Father, it is all through God the Son, and all is in the Holy Ghost as He is Himself all our good. God is Himself the portion and purchased inheritance of His people. Thus God is the Alpha and the Omega in this affair of redemption.</p>\n<p>If we suppose no more than used to be supposed about the Holy Ghost, the concern of the Holy Ghost in the work of redemption is not equal with the Father's and the Son's, nor is there an equal part of the glory of this work belonging to Him: merely to apply to us or immediately to give or hand to us the blessing purchased, after it was purchased, as subservient to the other two Persons, is but a little thing [compared] to the purchasing of it by the paying an Infinite price, by Christ offering up Himself in sacrifice to procure it, and it is but a little thing to God the Father's giving His infinitely dear Son to be a sacrifice for us and upon His purchase to afford to us all the blessings of His purchased.</p>\n<p>But according to this there is an equality. To be the love of God to the world is as much as for the Father and the Son to do so much from love to the world, and to be the thing purchased was as much as to be the price. The price and the thing bought with that price are equal. And it is as much as to afford the thing purchased, for the glory that belongs to Him that affords the thing purchased arises from the worth of that thing that He affords and therefore it is the same glory and an equal glory; the glory of the thing itself is its worth and that is also the glory of him that affords it.</p>\n<p>There are two more eminent and remarkable images of the Trinity among the creatures. The one is in the spiritual creation, the soul of man. There is the mind, and the understanding or idea, and the spirit of the mind as it is called in Scripture, i.e., the disposition, the will or affection. The other is in the visible creation, viz., the Sun. The father is as the substance of the Sun. (By substance I don't mean in a philosophical sense, but the Sun as to its internal constitution.) The Son is as the brightness and glory of the disk of the Sun or that bright and glorious form under which it appears to our eyes. The Holy Ghost is the action of the Sun which is within the Sun in its intestine heat, and, being diffusive, enlightens, warms, enlivens and comforts the world. The Spirit as it is God's Infinite love to Himself and happiness in Himself, is as the internal heat of the Sun, but as it is that by which God communicates Himself, it is as the emanation of the sun's action, or the emitted beams of the sun.</p>\n<p>The various sorts of rays of the sun and their beautiful colors do well represent the Spirit. They well represent the love and grace of God and were made use of for this purpose in the rainbow after the flood, and I suppose also in that rainbow that was seen round about the throne by Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:28; Rev. 4:3) and round the head of Christ by John (Rev. 10:1), or the amiable excellency of God and the various beautiful graces and virtues of the Spirit. These beautiful colors of the sunbeams we find made use of in Scripture for this purpose, viz., to represent the graces of the Spirit, as (Ps. 68:13) &quot;Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold,&quot; i.e., like the light reflected in various beautiful colors from the feathers of a dove, which colors represent the graces of the Heavenly Dove.</p>\n<p>The same I suppose is signified by the various beautiful colors reflected from the precious stones of the breastplate, and that these spiritual ornaments of the Church are what are represented by the various colors of the foundation and gates of the new Jerusalem (Rev. 21; Isaiah 54:11, etc.) and the stones of the Temple (I Chron. 29: 2); and I believe the variety there is in the rays of the Sun and their beautiful colors was designed by the Creator for this very purpose, and indeed that the whole visible creation which is but the shadow of being is so made and ordered by God as to typify and represent spiritual things, for which I could give many reasons. (I don't propose this merely as an hypothesis but as a part of Divine truth sufficiently and fully ascertained by the revelation God has made in the Holy Scriptures.)</p>\n<p>I am sensible what kind of objections many will be ready to make against what has been said, what difficulties will be immediately found, How can this be? And how can that be!</p>\n<p>I am far from affording this as any explication of this mystery, that unfolds and renews the mysteriousness and incomprehensibleness of it, for I am sensible that however by what has been said some difficulties are lessened, others that are new appear, and the number of those things that appear mysterious, wonderful and incomprehensible, is increased by it. I offer it only as a farther manifestation of what of Divine truth the Word of God exhibits to the view of our minds concerning this great mystery.</p>\n<p>I think the Word of God teaches us more things concerning it to be believed by us than have been generally believed, and that it exhibits many things concerning it exceeding [i.e., more] glorious and wonderful than have been taken notice of; yea, that it reveals or exhibits many more wonderful mysteries than those which have been taken notice of; which mysteries that have been overvalued are incomprehensible things and yet have been exhibited in the Word of God tho they are an addition to the number of mysteries that are in it. No wonder that the more things we are told concerning that which is so infinitely above our reach, the number of visible mysteries increases.</p>\n<p>When we tell a child a little concerning God he has not an hundredth part so many mysteries in view on the nature and attributes of God and His works of creation and Providence as one that is told much concerning God in a Divinity School; and yet he knows much more about God and has a much clearer understanding of things of Divinity and is able more clearly to explicate some things that were dark and very unintelligible to him; I humbly apprehend that the things that have been observed increase the number of visible mysteries in the Godhead in no other manner than as by them we perceive that God has told us much more about it than was before generally observed.</p>\n<p>Under the Old Testament the Church of God was not told near so much about the Trinity as they are now. But what the New Testament has revealed, tho it has more opened to our view the nature of God, yet it has increased the number of visible mysteries and they thus appear to us exceeding wonderful and incomprehensible. And so also it has come to pass in the Church being told [i.e., that the churches are told] more about the incarnation and the satisfaction of Christ and other Gospel doctrines.</p>\n<p>It is so not only in Divine things but natural things. He that looks on a plant, or the parts of the bodies of animals, or any other works of nature, at a great distance where he has but an obscure sight-of it, may see something in it wonderful and beyond his comprehension, but he that is near to it and views them narrowly indeed understands more about them, has a clearer and distinct sight of them, and yet the number of things that are wonderful and mysterious in them that appear to him are much more than before, and, if he views them with a microscope, the number of the wonders that he sees will be increased still but yet the microscope gives him more a true knowledge concerning them.</p>\n<p>God is never said to love the Holy Ghost nor are any epithets that betoken love anywhere given to Him, tho so many are ascribed to the Son, as God's Elect, The Beloved, He in Whom God's soul delights, He in Whom He is well pleased, etc. Yea such epithets seem to be ascribed to the Son as tho He were the object of love exclusive of all other persons, as tho there were no person whatsoever to share the love of the Father with the Son. To this purpose evidently He is called God's Only Begotten Son, at the time that it is added, &quot;In Whom He is well pleased.&quot; There is nothing in Scripture that speaks of any acceptance of the Holy Ghost or any reward or any mutual friendship between the Holy Ghost and either of the other Persons, or any command to love the Holy Ghost or to delight in or have any complacence in [the Holy Ghost], tho such commands are so frequent with respect to the other Persons.</p>\n<p>That knowledge or understanding in God which we must conceive of as first is His knowledge of everything possible. That love which must be this knowledge is what we must conceive of as belonging to the essence of the Godhead in it's first subsistence. Then comes a reflex act of knowledge and His viewing Himself and knowing Himself and so knowing His own knowledge and so the Son is begotten. There is such a thing in God as knowledge of knowledge, an idea of an idea. Which can be nothing else than the idea or knowledge repeated.</p>\n<p>The world was made for the Son of God especially. For God made the world for Himself from love to Himself; but God loves Himself only in a reflex act. He views Himself and so loves Himself, so He makes the world for Himself viewed and reflected on, and that is. The same with Himself repeated or begotten in His own idea, and that is His Son. When God considers of making any thing for Himself He presents Himself before Himself and views Himself as His End, and that viewing Himself is the same as reflecting on Himself or having an idea of Himself, and to make the world for the Godhead thus viewed and understood is to make the world for the Godhead begotten and that is to make the world for the Son of God.</p>\n<p>The love of God as it flows forth ad extra is wholly determined and directed by Divine wisdom, so that those only are the objects of it that Divine wisdom chooses, so that the creation of the world is to gratify Divine love as that is exercised by Divine wisdom. But Christ is Divine wisdom so that the world is made to gratify Divine love as exercised by Christ or to gratify the love that is in Christ's heart, or to provide a spouse for Christ. Those creatures which wisdom chooses for the object of Divine love as Christ's elect spouse and especially those elect creatures that wisdom chiefly pitches upon and makes the end of the rest of creatures.</p>\n","parentDir":"2016-03-11, Essay on the Trinity","baseid":"33f8978b3a","id":"47a9a7c740","slug":"2016-03-10_essay-on-the-trinity-it_it","base":{"id":"9804af95ac","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Essay on the Trinity","slug":"2016-03-10_essay-on-the-trinity","language":"en","author":"Jonathan Edwards","img":"2000px-Society_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Most_Holy_Trinity_badge.svg.png"},"tagmatches":[{"id":"d299f53dce","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Developing a Good Heart IT","slug":"2018-11-17_developing-a-good-heart-it_it","language":"it","author":"Dalai Lama","img":"Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg"},{"id":"9a1dfc5410","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Thomas Merton Memoirs about Interfaith IT","slug":"2016-10-26_thomas-merton-memoirs-about-interfaith-it_it","language":"it","author":"Thomas Merton","img":"Dhirendra-Brahmachari.jpeg"},{"id":"aef757839a","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"On Enlightening the Mind IT","slug":"2016-08-13_on-enlightening-the-mind-it_it","language":"it","author":"Moses Mendelssohn","img":"What-if-Artificial-Intelligence-Was-Enlightened-1038x583.jpg"},{"id":"96a532a400","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Be Like Adam’s Son IT","slug":"2016-08-01_be-like-adams-son-it_it","language":"it","author":"Jawdat Sa’eed","img":"adam-and-eve-with-the-infants-cain-and-abel-lorenzo-de-ferrari.jpg"}],"previnfo":{"id":"96a532a400","tags":"sit amet,consectetur","title":"Be Like Adam’s Son IT","slug":"2016-08-01_be-like-adams-son-it_it","language":"it","author":"Jawdat Sa’eed","img":"adam-and-eve-with-the-infants-cain-and-abel-lorenzo-de-ferrari.jpg"},"nextinfo":{"id":"f0df9ae245","tags":"race,vision","title":"Ho un sogno","slug":"2019-02-10_ho-un-sogno_it","language":"it","author":"Martin Luther King Jr.","img":"Martin-Luther-King.jpg"}}]
