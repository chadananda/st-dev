Now that we have all enjoyed celebrating the Bicentennial of the birth of the Báb, it’s probably about time we get serious about doing that.\n\nTogether, we will read and discuss every page of the Dawn-Breakers, track every character, map every city and essentially rise to the Guardian’s challenge that we *“...master and digest the facts recorded therein...”* It’s going to be a lot of work and a lot of fun.\n\nOur outcome goals are clear: participants should know the stories and be able to identify the twenty-six key characters — as well as be able to accompany others in reading these important books once they return home.  As the Guardian promised us, *“No one can read The Dawn-Breakers and remain cold and unreceptive.”* Studying that book is a powerful spiritual journey — a quickening of the soul.\n\n\n\n\n\n![group photo of dawn-breakers challenge 2019 participants](/db-challenge/db-chall-jul-2019.jpg#floater)\n### Where will this be held?\n\nIn the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms.

The school has various accommodation options, so families will usually be able to stay together.\n\n### When?\n\nEarly every month in 2020 -- beginning with April. We know everyone has different schedules and commitments, so we thought, “Let’s just keep repeating every month, all year! Surely anyone who really wants to attend can find some month that works.”\n\n\n\n![participants dawn-breakers challenge 2019](/db-challenge/participants.jpg#floater)\n### Who should attend?

We will not be splitting out into groups so all participants should be mature enough to sustain a solid day of reading together.\n\n### Why should I do this now? (if not now, then when?)\n\nThe Guardian assures us that studying the Dawn-Breakers has a profound mystical effect on our dormant spiritual powers. It should not be a surprise therefore that Shoghi Effendi called on all the Baha’is (especially the youth) to master this book as a basis for teaching. He explained that it is not just a book of history, but a book of meditation. And he assured us that studying that book would quicken our dormant energies in a completely new way.\n\nBut let’s be honest. It’s a very difficult book, Northern California is far away, 10 days is a lot of time and the demands of our material life fill up our calendars, sometimes years in advance. Nevertheless, the bicentennial of the birth of the Báb is now upon us! So, if not now, then when?\n\nWhatever your current plans are this summer, we hope you will change them and join our little mountain retreat for a few days of spiritual adventure.\n\n\n![bring Ocean 2.0](/db-challenge/bayan-db-challenge.jpg#floater)\n### What to Bring?

One of the last major works of the Báb, this book was written within the first days of the spring of 1850, the final year of the Báb's life, three or four months before His martyrdom. Panj Sha'n consists of nineteen chapters, each dealing with one of the names of God, corresponding to the first nineteen days of the year, that is, the days of the month of Bahá (Glory). These names also correspond to the nineteen figures of the Bábí Primal Unity. Panj Sha'n explains many fundamental spiritual concepts such as nearness to God, light, beauty, and unity. Each chapter was written in honour of one of the Bábís, and the chapters can all be considered as independent tablets as well. The Tablet of Hurufat, or Tablet of Nineteen Temples, is one of these chapters.\n\n\n####  On the Kitáb-i-Íqán, from “God Passes By”\n\n> Foremost among the priceless treasures cast forth from the billowing ocean of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation ranks the **Kitáb-i-Íqán** (Book of Certitude), revealed within the space of two days and two nights, in the closing years of that period (1278 A. H.–1862 A.D.). It was written in fulfillment of the prophecy of the Báb, Who had specifically stated that the Promised One would complete the text of the unfinished Persian Bayán\n\n\n---\n<br><br>\n\n\n![school front](/courses/school-front2.jpg#floater)\n### Where will this be held?\n\nIn the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms.

One of the last major works of the Báb, this book was written within the first days of the spring of 1850, the final year of the Báb's life, three or four months before His martyrdom. Panj Sha'n consists of nineteen chapters, each dealing with one of the names of God, corresponding to the first nineteen days of the year, that is, the days of the month of Bahá (Glory). These names also correspond to the nineteen figures of the Bábí Primal Unity. Panj Sha'n explains many fundamental spiritual concepts such as nearness to God, light, beauty, and unity. Each chapter was written in honour of one of the Bábís, and the chapters can all be considered as independent tablets as well. The Tablet of Hurufat, or Tablet of Nineteen Temples, is one of these chapters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>On the Kitáb-i-Íqán, from “God Passes By”</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Foremost among the priceless treasures cast forth from the billowing ocean of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation ranks the <strong>Kitáb-i-Íqán</strong> (Book of Certitude), revealed within the space of two days and two nights, in the closing years of that period (1278 A. H.–1862 A.D.). It was written in fulfillment of the prophecy of the Báb, Who had specifically stated that the Promised One would complete the text of the unfinished Persian Bayán</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"/courses/school-front2.jpg#floater\" alt=\"school front\" /></p>\n<h3>Where will this be held?</h3>\n<p>In the mountains of Northern California, just East of Sacramento, our friends have a beautiful boarding-school facility with a gymnasium and comfortable classrooms.
